Chapter 4. The `class` File Format
==================================


This chapter describes the `class` file format of the Java Virtual Machine. Each `class` file contains the definition of a single class, interface, or module. Although a class, interface, or module need not have an external representation literally contained in a file (for instance, because the class is generated by a class loader), we will colloquially refer to any valid representation of a class, interface, or module as being in the `class` file format.

A `class` file consists of a stream of 8-bit bytes. 16-bit and 32-bit quantities are constructed by reading in two and four consecutive 8-bit bytes, respectively. Multibyte data items are always stored in big-endian order, where the high bytes come first. This chapter defines the data types `u1`, `u2`, and `u4` to represent an unsigned one-, two-, or four-byte quantity, respectively.

In the Java SE Platform API, the `class` file format is supported by interfaces `java.io.DataInput` and `java.io.DataOutput` and classes such as `java.io.DataInputStream` and `java.io.DataOutputStream`. For example, values of the types `u1`, `u2`, and `u4` may be read by methods such as `readUnsignedByte`, `readUnsignedShort`, and `readInt` of the interface `java.io.DataInput`.

This chapter presents the `class` file format using pseudostructures written in a C-like structure notation. To avoid confusion with the fields of classes and class instances, etc., the contents of the structures describing the `class` file format are referred to as _items_. Successive items are stored in the `class` file sequentially, without padding or alignment.

_Tables_, consisting of zero or more variable-sized items, are used in several `class` file structures. Although we use C-like array syntax to refer to table items, the fact that tables are streams of varying-sized structures means that it is not possible to translate a table index directly to a byte offset into the table.

Where we refer to a data structure as an _array_, it consists of zero or more contiguous fixed-sized items and can be indexed like an array.

Reference to an ASCII character in this chapter should be interpreted to mean the Unicode code point corresponding to the ASCII character.

4.1. The `ClassFile` Structure
------------------------------

A `class` file consists of a single `ClassFile` structure:

```
ClassFile {
    u4             magic;
    u2             minor\_version;
    u2             major\_version;
    u2             constant\_pool\_count;
    cp\_info        constant\_pool\[constant\_pool\_count-1\];
    u2             access\_flags;
    u2             this\_class;
    u2             super\_class;
    u2             interfaces\_count;
    u2             interfaces\[interfaces\_count\];
    u2             fields\_count;
    field\_info     fields\[fields\_count\];
    u2             methods\_count;
    method\_info    methods\[methods\_count\];
    u2             attributes\_count;
    attribute\_info attributes\[attributes\_count\];
}

```

The items in the `ClassFile` structure are as follows:

magic

The `magic` item supplies the magic number identifying the `class` file format; it has the value `0xCAFEBABE`.

minor\_version, major\_version

The values of the `minor_version` and `major_version` items are the minor and major version numbers of this `class` file. Together, a major and a minor version number determine the version of the `class` file format. If a `class` file has major version number `M` and minor version number `m`, we denote the version of its `class` file format as `M`.`m`.

A Java Virtual Machine implementation which conforms to Java SE `N` must support exactly the major versions of the `class` file format specified in the fourth column of [Table 4.1-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-B.2 "Table 4.1-A. class file format major versions"), "Supported majors". The notation A .. B means major versions A through B, inclusive of both A and B. The third column, "Major", shows the major version introduced by each Java SE release, that is, the first release that could have accepted a `class` file containing that `major_version` item. For very early releases, the JDK version is shown instead of the Java SE release.

**Table 4.1-A. `class` file format major versions**

For a `class` file whose `major_version` is 56 or above, the `minor_version` must be 0 or 65535.

For a `class` file whose `major_version` is between 45 and 55 inclusive, the `minor_version` may be any value.

A historical perspective is warranted on JDK support for `class` file format versions. JDK 1.0.2 supported versions 45.0 through 45.3 inclusive. JDK 1.1 supported versions 45.0 through 45.65535 inclusive. When JDK 1.2 introduced support for major version 46, the only minor version supported under that major version was 0. Later JDKs continued the practice of introducing support for a new major version (47, 48, etc) but supporting only a minor version of 0 under the new major version. Finally, the introduction of preview features in Java SE 12 (see below) motivated a standard role for the minor version of the `class` file format, so JDK 12 supported minor versions of 0 _and_ 65535 under major version 56. Subsequent JDKs introduce support for `N`.0 and `N`.65535 where `N` is the corresponding major version of the implemented Java SE Platform. For example, JDK 13 supports 57.0 and 57.65535.

The Java SE Platform may define _preview features_. A Java Virtual Machine implementation which conforms to Java SE `N` (`N` ≥ 12) must support all the preview features of Java SE `N`, and none of the preview features of any other Java SE release. The implementation must by default disable the supported preview features, and must provide a way to enable all of them, and must not provide a way to enable only some of them.

A `class` file is said to _depend on the preview features of Java SE `N`_ (`N` ≥ 12) if it has a `major_version` that corresponds to Java SE `N` (according to [Table 4.1-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-B.2 "Table 4.1-A. class file format major versions")) and a `minor_version` of 65535.

A Java Virtual Machine implementation which conforms to Java SE `N` (`N` ≥ 12) must behave as follows:

*   A `class` file that depends on the preview features of Java SE `N` may be loaded only when the preview features of Java SE `N` are enabled.
    
*   A `class` file that depends on the preview features of another Java SE release must never be loaded.
    
*   A `class` file that does not depend on the preview features of any Java SE release may be loaded regardless of whether the preview features of Java SE `N` are enabled.
    

constant\_pool\_count

The value of the `constant_pool_count` item is equal to the number of entries in the `constant_pool` table plus one. A `constant_pool` index is considered valid if it is greater than zero and less than `constant_pool_count`, with the exception for constants of type `long` and `double` noted in [§4.4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.5 "4.4.5. The CONSTANT_Long_info and CONSTANT_Double_info Structures").

constant\_pool\[\]

The `constant_pool` is a table of structures ([§4.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4 "4.4. The Constant Pool")) representing various string constants, class and interface names, field names, and other constants that are referred to within the `ClassFile` structure and its substructures. The format of each `constant_pool` table entry is indicated by its first "tag" byte.

The `constant_pool` table is indexed from 1 to `constant_pool_count` - 1.

access\_flags

The value of the `access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permissions to and properties of this class or interface. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is specified in [Table 4.1-B](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1 "Table 4.1-B. Class access and property modifiers").

**Table 4.1-B. Class access and property modifiers**

  
| Flag Name | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACC_PUBLIC` | 0x0001 | Declared `public`; may be accessed from outside its package. |
| `ACC_FINAL` | 0x0010 | Declared `final`; no subclasses allowed. |
| `ACC_SUPER` | 0x0020 | Treat superclass methods specially when invoked by the _invokespecial_ instruction. |
| `ACC_INTERFACE` | 0x0200 | Is an interface, not a class. |
| `ACC_ABSTRACT` | 0x0400 | Declared `abstract`; must not be instantiated. |
| `ACC_SYNTHETIC` | 0x1000 | Declared synthetic; not present in the source code. |
| `ACC_ANNOTATION` | 0x2000 | Declared as an annotation interface. |
| `ACC_ENUM` | 0x4000 | Declared as an `enum` class. |
| 
`ACC_MODULE`

 | 0x8000 | Is a module, not a class or interface. |

  

The `ACC_MODULE` flag indicates that this `class` file defines a module, not a class or interface. If the `ACC_MODULE` flag is set, then special rules apply to the `class` file which are given at the end of this section. If the `ACC_MODULE` flag is not set, then the rules immediately below the current paragraph apply to the `class` file.

An interface is distinguished by the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag being set. If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is not set, this `class` file defines a class, not an interface or module.

If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is set, the `ACC_ABSTRACT` flag must also be set, and the `ACC_FINAL`, `ACC_SUPER`, `ACC_ENUM`, and `ACC_MODULE` flags set must not be set.

If the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag is not set, any of the other flags in [Table 4.1-B](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1 "Table 4.1-B. Class access and property modifiers") may be set except `ACC_ANNOTATION` and `ACC_MODULE`. However, such a `class` file must not have both its `ACC_FINAL` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags set (JLS §8.1.1.2).

The `ACC_SUPER` flag indicates which of two alternative semantics is to be expressed by the _invokespecial_ instruction ([§_invokespecial_](jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokespecial "invokespecial")) if it appears in this class or interface. Compilers to the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine should set the `ACC_SUPER` flag. In Java SE 8 and above, the Java Virtual Machine considers the `ACC_SUPER` flag to be set in every `class` file, regardless of the actual value of the flag in the `class` file and the version of the `class` file.

The `ACC_SUPER` flag exists for backward compatibility with code compiled by older compilers for the Java programming language. Prior to JDK 1.0.2, the compiler generated `access_flags` in which the flag now representing `ACC_SUPER` had no assigned meaning, and Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation ignored the flag if it was set.

The `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag indicates that this class or interface was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code.

An annotation interface (JLS §9.6) must have its `ACC_ANNOTATION` flag set. If the `ACC_ANNOTATION` flag is set, the `ACC_INTERFACE` flag must also be set.

The `ACC_ENUM` flag indicates that this class or its superclass is declared as an enum class (JLS §8.9).

All bits of the `access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.1-B](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1-200-E.1 "Table 4.1-B. Class access and property modifiers") are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

this\_class

The value of the `this_class` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing the class or interface defined by this `class` file.

super\_class

For a class, the value of the `super_class` item either must be zero or must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. If the value of the `super_class` item is nonzero, the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing the direct superclass of the class defined by this `class` file. Neither the direct superclass nor any of its superclasses may have the `ACC_FINAL` flag set in the `access_flags` item of its `ClassFile` structure.

If the value of the `super_class` item is zero, then this `class` file must represent the class `Object`, the only class or interface without a direct superclass.

For an interface, the value of the `super_class` item must always be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing the class `Object`.

interfaces\_count

The value of the `interfaces_count` item gives the number of direct superinterfaces of this class or interface type.

interfaces\[\]

Each value in the `interfaces` array must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at each value of `interfaces[_i_]`, where 0 ≤ _i_ < `interfaces_count`, must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing an interface that is a direct superinterface of this class or interface type, in the left-to-right order given in the source for the type.

fields\_count

The value of the `fields_count` item gives the number of `field_info` structures in the `fields` table. The `field_info` structures represent all fields, both class variables and instance variables, declared by this class or interface type.

fields\[\]

Each value in the `fields` table must be a `field_info` structure ([§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields")) giving a complete description of a field in this class or interface. The `fields` table includes only those fields that are declared by this class or interface. It does not include items representing fields that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.

methods\_count

The value of the `methods_count` item gives the number of `method_info` structures in the `methods` table.

methods\[\]

Each value in the `methods` table must be a `method_info` structure ([§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")) giving a complete description of a method in this class or interface. If neither of the `ACC_NATIVE` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags are set in the `access_flags` item of a `method_info` structure, the Java Virtual Machine instructions implementing the method are also supplied.

The `method_info` structures represent all methods declared by this class or interface type, including instance methods, class methods, instance initialization methods ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")), and any class or interface initialization method ([§2.9.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.2 "2.9.2. Class Initialization Methods")). The `methods` table does not include items representing methods that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.

attributes\_count

The value of the `attributes_count` item gives the number of attributes in the `attributes` table of this class.

attributes\[\]

Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes")).

The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-320 "Table 4.7-C. Predefined class file attributes (by location)").

The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are given in [§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes").

The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure are given in [§4.7.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.1 "4.7.1. Defining and Naming New Attributes").

If the `ACC_MODULE` flag is set in the `access_flags` item, then no other flag in the `access_flags` item may be set, and the following rules apply to the rest of the `ClassFile` structure:

*   `major_version`, `minor_version`: ≥ 53.0 (i.e., Java SE 9 and above)
    
*   `this_class`: `module-info`
    
*   `super_class`, `interfaces_count`, `fields_count`, `methods_count`: zero
    
*   `attributes`: One `Module` attribute must be present. Except for `Module`, `ModulePackages`, `ModuleMainClass`, `InnerClasses`, `SourceFile`, `SourceDebugExtension`, `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations`, and `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations`, none of the pre-defined attributes ([§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes")) may appear.
    

4.2. Names
----------

### 4.2.1. Binary Class and Interface Names

Class and interface names that appear in `class` file structures are always represented in a fully qualified form known as _binary names_ (JLS §13.1). Such names are always represented as `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structures ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) and thus may be drawn, where not further constrained, from the entire Unicode codespace. Class and interface names are referenced from those `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structures ([§4.4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6 "4.4.6. The CONSTANT_NameAndType_info Structure")) which have such names as part of their descriptor ([§4.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3 "4.3. Descriptors")), and from all `CONSTANT_Class_info` structures ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")).

For historical reasons, the syntax of binary names that appear in `class` file structures differs from the syntax of binary names documented in JLS §13.1. In this internal form, the ASCII periods (`.`) that normally separate the identifiers which make up the binary name are replaced by ASCII forward slashes (`/`). The identifiers themselves must be unqualified names ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")).

For example, the normal binary name of class `Thread` is `java.lang.Thread`. In the internal form used in descriptors in the `class` file format, a reference to the name of class `Thread` is implemented using a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing the string `java/lang/Thread`.

### 4.2.2. Unqualified Names

Names of methods, fields, local variables, and formal parameters are stored as _unqualified names_. An unqualified name must contain at least one Unicode code point and must not contain any of the ASCII characters `.` `;` `[` `/` (that is, period or semicolon or left square bracket or forward slash).

Method names are further constrained so that, with the exception of the special method names `<init>` and `<clinit>` ([§2.9](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9 "2.9. Special Methods")), they must not contain the ASCII characters `<` or `>` (that is, left angle bracket or right angle bracket).

Note that no method invocation instruction may reference `<clinit>`, and only the _invokespecial_ instruction ([§_invokespecial_](jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokespecial "invokespecial")) may reference `<init>`.

### 4.2.3. Module and Package Names

Module names referenced from the `Module` attribute are stored in `CONSTANT_Module_info` structures in the constant pool ([§4.4.11](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.11 "4.4.11. The CONSTANT_Module_info Structure")). A `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure wraps a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure that denotes the module name. Module names are not encoded in "internal form" like class and interface names, that is, the ASCII periods (`.`) that separate the identifiers in a module name are not replaced by ASCII forward slashes (`/`).

Module names may be drawn from the entire Unicode codespace, subject to the following constraints:

*   A module name must not contain any code point in the range '`\u0000`' to '`\u001F`' inclusive.
    
*   The ASCII backslash (`\`) is reserved for use as an escape character in module names. It must not appear in a module name unless it is followed by an ASCII backslash, an ASCII colon (`:`), or an ASCII at-sign (`@`). The ASCII character sequence `\``\` may be used to encode a backslash in a module name.
    
*   The ASCII colon (`:`) and at-sign (`@`) are reserved for future use in module names. They must not appear in module names unless they are escaped. The ASCII character sequences `\``:` and `\``@` may be used to encode a colon and an at-sign in a module name.
    

Package names referenced from the `Module` attribute are stored in `CONSTANT_Package_info` structures in the constant pool ([§4.4.12](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.12 "4.4.12. The CONSTANT_Package_info Structure")). A `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure wraps a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure that represents a package name encoded in internal form.

4.3. Descriptors
----------------

A _descriptor_ is a string representing the type of a field or method. Descriptors are represented in the `class` file format using modified UTF-8 strings ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) and thus may be drawn, where not further constrained, from the entire Unicode codespace.

### 4.3.1. Grammar Notation

Descriptors are specified using a grammar. The grammar is a set of productions that describe how sequences of characters can form syntactically correct descriptors of various kinds. Terminal symbols of the grammar are shown in `fixed width` font. Nonterminal symbols are shown in _italic_ type. The definition of a nonterminal is introduced by the name of the nonterminal being defined, followed by a colon. One or more alternative definitions for the nonterminal then follow on succeeding lines.

The syntax _{x}_ on the right-hand side of a production denotes zero or more occurrences of _x_.

The phrase _(one of)_ on the right-hand side of a production signifies that each of the terminal symbols on the following line or lines is an alternative definition.

### 4.3.2. Field Descriptors

A _field descriptor_ represents the type of a class, instance, or local variable.

FieldDescriptor:

[FieldType](jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType "FieldType")

FieldType:

[BaseType](jvms-4.html#jvms-BaseType "BaseType")  
[ObjectType](jvms-4.html#jvms-ObjectType "ObjectType")  
[ArrayType](jvms-4.html#jvms-ArrayType "ArrayType")

BaseType:

(one of)  
`B` `C` `D` `F` `I` `J` `S` `Z`

ObjectType:

`L` ClassName `;`

ArrayType:

`[` [ComponentType](jvms-4.html#jvms-ComponentType "ComponentType")

ComponentType:

[FieldType](jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType "FieldType")

The characters of _BaseType_, the `L` and `;` of _ObjectType_, and the `[` of _ArrayType_ are all ASCII characters.

_ClassName_ represents a binary class or interface name encoded in internal form ([§4.2.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.1 "4.2.1. Binary Class and Interface Names")).

The interpretation of field descriptors as types is shown in [Table 4.3-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2-200 "Table 4.3-A. Interpretation of field descriptors").

A field descriptor representing an array type is valid only if it represents a type with 255 or fewer dimensions.

**Table 4.3-A. Interpretation of field descriptors**

  
| _FieldType_ term | Type | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `B` | `byte` | signed byte |
| `C` | `char` | Unicode character code point in the Basic Multilingual Plane, encoded with UTF-16 |
| `D` | `double` | double-precision floating-point value |
| `F` | `float` | single-precision floating-point value |
| `I` | `int` | integer |
| `J` | `long` | long integer |
| `L` _ClassName_ `;` | `reference` | an instance of class _ClassName_ |
| `S` | `short` | signed short |
| `Z` | `boolean` | `true` or `false` |
| `[` | `reference` | one array dimension |

  

The field descriptor of an instance variable of type `int` is simply `I`.

The field descriptor of an instance variable of type `Object` is `Ljava/lang/Object;`. Note that the internal form of the binary name for class `Object` is used.

The field descriptor of an instance variable of the multidimensional array type `double[][][]` is `[[[D`.

### 4.3.3. Method Descriptors

A _method descriptor_ contains zero or more _parameter descriptors_, representing the types of parameters that the method takes, and a _return descriptor_, representing the type of the value (if any) that the method returns.

MethodDescriptor:

`(` {[ParameterDescriptor](jvms-4.html#jvms-ParameterDescriptor "ParameterDescriptor")} `)` [ReturnDescriptor](jvms-4.html#jvms-ReturnDescriptor "ReturnDescriptor")

ParameterDescriptor:

[FieldType](jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType "FieldType")

ReturnDescriptor:

[FieldType](jvms-4.html#jvms-FieldType "FieldType")  
[VoidDescriptor](jvms-4.html#jvms-VoidDescriptor "VoidDescriptor")

VoidDescriptor:

`V`

The character `V` indicates that the method returns no value (its result is `void`).

The method descriptor for the method:

```
Object m(int i, double d, Thread t) {...}

```

is:

```
(IDLjava/lang/Thread;)Ljava/lang/Object;

```

Note that the internal forms of the binary names of `Thread` and `Object` are used.

A method descriptor is valid only if it represents method parameters with a total length of 255 or less, where that length includes the contribution for `this` in the case of instance or interface method invocations. The total length is calculated by summing the contributions of the individual parameters, where a parameter of type `long` or `double` contributes two units to the length and a parameter of any other type contributes one unit.

A method descriptor is the same whether the method it describes is a class method or an instance method. Although an instance method is passed `this`, a reference to the object on which the method is being invoked, in addition to its intended arguments, that fact is not reflected in the method descriptor. The reference to `this` is passed implicitly by the Java Virtual Machine instructions which invoke instance methods ([§2.6.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6.1 "2.6.1. Local Variables"), [§4.11](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.11 "4.11. Limitations of the Java Virtual Machine")).

4.4. The Constant Pool
----------------------

Java Virtual Machine instructions do not rely on the run-time layout of classes, interfaces, class instances, or arrays. Instead, instructions refer to symbolic information in the `constant_pool` table.

All `constant_pool` table entries have the following general format:

```
cp\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u1 info\[\];
}

```

Each entry in the `constant_pool` table must begin with a 1-byte tag indicating the kind of constant denoted by the entry. There are 17 kinds of constant, listed in [Table 4.4-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4-140 "Table 4.4-A. Constant pool tags (by section)") with their corresponding tags, and ordered by their section number in this chapter. Each tag byte must be followed by two or more bytes giving information about the specific constant. The format of the additional information depends on the tag byte, that is, the content of the `info` array varies with the value of `tag`.

In a `class` file whose version number is _v_, each entry in the `constant_pool` table must have a tag that was first defined in version _v_ or earlier of the `class` file format ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). That is, each entry must denote a kind of constant that is approved for use in the `class` file. [Table 4.4-B](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4-210 "Table 4.4-B. Constant pool tags (by tag)") lists each tag with the first version of the `class` file format in which it was defined. Also shown is the version of the Java SE Platform which introduced that version of the `class` file format.

**Table 4.4-B. Constant pool tags (by tag)**

   
| Constant Kind | Tag | `class` file format | Java SE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CONSTANT_Utf8` | 1 | 45.3 | 1.0.2 |
| `CONSTANT_Integer` | 3 | 45.3 | 1.0.2 |
| `CONSTANT_Float` | 4 | 45.3 | 1.0.2 |

| `CONSTANT_Module` | 19 | 53.0 | 9 |
| `CONSTANT_Package` | 20 | 53.0 | 9 |

  

Some entries in the `constant_pool` table are _loadable_ because they represent entities that can be pushed onto the stack at run time to enable further computation. In a `class` file whose version number is _v_, an entry in the `constant_pool` table is loadable if it has a tag that was first deemed to be loadable in version _v_ or earlier of the `class` file format. [Table 4.4-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4-310 "Table 4.4-C. Loadable constant pool tags") lists each tag with the first version of the `class` file format in which it was deemed to be loadable. Also shown is the version of the Java SE Platform which introduced that version of the `class` file format.

In every case except `CONSTANT_Class`, a tag was first deemed to be loadable in the same version of the `class` file format that first defined the tag.

**Table 4.4-C. Loadable constant pool tags**

   
| Constant Kind | Tag | `class` file format | Java SE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CONSTANT_Integer` | 3 | 45.3 | 1.0.2 |
| `CONSTANT_Float` | 4 | 45.3 | 1.0.2 |
| `CONSTANT_Long` | 5 | 45.3 | 1.0.2 |
| `CONSTANT_Double` | 6 | 45.3 | 1.0.2 |

### 4.4.1. The `CONSTANT_Class_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure is used to represent a class or an interface:

```
CONSTANT\_Class\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 name\_index;
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_Class` (7).

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a valid binary class or interface name encoded in internal form ([§4.2.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.1 "4.2.1. Binary Class and Interface Names")).

Because arrays are objects, the opcodes _anewarray_ and _multianewarray_ - but not the opcode _new_ - can reference array "classes" via `CONSTANT_Class_info` structures in the `constant_pool` table. For such array classes, the name of the class is the descriptor of the array type ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")).

For example, the class name representing the two-dimensional array type `int[][]` is `[[I`, while the class name representing the type `Thread[]` is `[Ljava/lang/Thread;`.

An array type descriptor is valid only if it represents 255 or fewer dimensions.

### 4.4.2. The `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info`, `CONSTANT_Methodref_info`, and `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` Structures

Fields, methods, and interface methods are represented by similar structures:

```
CONSTANT\_Fieldref\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 class\_index;
    u2 name\_and\_type\_index;
}

CONSTANT\_Methodref\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 class\_index;
    u2 name\_and\_type\_index;
}

CONSTANT\_InterfaceMethodref\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 class\_index;
    u2 name\_and\_type\_index;
}

```

The items of these structures are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Fieldref` (9).

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Methodref` (10).

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref` (11).

class\_index

The value of the `class_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing a class or interface type that has the field or method as a member.

In a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure, the `class_index` item may be either a class type or an interface type.

In a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure, the `class_index` item should be a class type, not an interface type.

In a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure, the `class_index` item should be an interface type, not a class type.

name\_and\_type\_index

The value of the `name_and_type_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure ([§4.4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6 "4.4.6. The CONSTANT_NameAndType_info Structure")). This `constant_pool` entry indicates the name and descriptor of the field or method.

In a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure, the indicated descriptor must be a field descriptor ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")). Otherwise, the indicated descriptor must be a method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).

If the name of the method in a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure begins with a '`<`' ('`\u003c`'), then the name must be the special name `<init>`, representing an instance initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")). The return type of such a method must be `void`.

### 4.4.3. The `CONSTANT_String_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_String_info` structure is used to represent constant objects of the type `String`:

```
CONSTANT\_String\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 string\_index;
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_String_info` structure are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_String` (8).

string\_index

The value of the `string_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the sequence of Unicode code points to which the `String` object is to be initialized.

### 4.4.4. The `CONSTANT_Integer_info` and `CONSTANT_Float_info` Structures

The `CONSTANT_Integer_info` and `CONSTANT_Float_info` structures represent 4-byte numeric (`int` and `float`) constants:

```
CONSTANT\_Integer\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 bytes;
}

CONSTANT\_Float\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 bytes;
}

```

The items of these structures are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Integer_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Integer` (3).

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Float_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Float` (4).

bytes

The `bytes` item of the `CONSTANT_Integer_info` structure represents the value of the `int` constant. The bytes of the value are stored in big-endian (high byte first) order.

The `bytes` item of the `CONSTANT_Float_info` structure represents the value of the `float` constant in IEEE 754 binary32 floating-point format ([§2.3.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3.2 "2.3.2. Floating-Point Types and Values")). The bytes of the item are stored in big-endian (high byte first) order.

The value represented by the `CONSTANT_Float_info` structure is determined as follows. The bytes of the value are first converted into an `int` constant _bits_. Then:

*   If _bits_ is `0x7f800000`, the `float` value will be positive infinity.
    
*   If _bits_ is `0xff800000`, the `float` value will be negative infinity.
    
*   If _bits_ is in the range `0x7f800001` through `0x7fffffff` or in the range `0xff800001` through `0xffffffff`, the `float` value will be NaN.
    
*   In all other cases, let `s`, `e`, and `m` be three values that might be computed from _bits_:
    
    ```
    int s = ((_bits_ >> 31) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
    int e = ((_bits_ >> 23) & 0xff);
    int m = (e == 0) ?
              (_bits_ & 0x7fffff) << 1 :
              (_bits_ & 0x7fffff) | 0x800000;
    	  
    ```
    

Then the `float` value equals the result of the mathematical expression `s · m · 2e-150`.

### 4.4.5. The `CONSTANT_Long_info` and `CONSTANT_Double_info` Structures

The `CONSTANT_Long_info` and `CONSTANT_Double_info` represent 8-byte numeric (`long` and `double`) constants:

```
CONSTANT\_Long\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 high\_bytes;
    u4 low\_bytes;
}

CONSTANT\_Double\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u4 high\_bytes;
    u4 low\_bytes;
}

```

All 8-byte constants take up two entries in the `constant_pool` table of the `class` file. If a `CONSTANT_Long_info` or `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure is the entry at index _n_ in the `constant_pool` table, then the next usable entry in the table is located at index _n_+2. The `constant_pool` index _n_+1 must be valid but is considered unusable.

In retrospect, making 8-byte constants take two constant pool entries was a poor choice.

The items of these structures are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Long_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Long` (5).

The `tag` item of the `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Double` (6).

high\_bytes, low\_bytes

The unsigned `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items of the `CONSTANT_Long_info` structure together represent the value of the `long` constant

```
((long) high\_bytes << 32) + low\_bytes
      
```

where the bytes of each of `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` are stored in big-endian (high byte first) order.

The `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items of the `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure together represent the `double` value in IEEE 754 binary64 floating-point format ([§2.3.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3.2 "2.3.2. Floating-Point Types and Values")). The bytes of each item are stored in big-endian (high byte first) order.

The value represented by the `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure is determined as follows. The `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items are converted into the `long` constant _bits_, which is equal to

```
((long) high\_bytes << 32) + low\_bytes
      
```

Then:

*   If _bits_ is `0x7ff0000000000000L`, the `double` value will be positive infinity.
    
*   If _bits_ is `0xfff0000000000000L`, the `double` value will be negative infinity.
    
*   If _bits_ is in the range `0x7ff0000000000001L` through `0x7fffffffffffffffL` or in the range `0xfff0000000000001L` through `0xffffffffffffffffL`, the double value will be NaN.
    
*   In all other cases, let `s`, `e`, and `m` be three values that might be computed from _bits_:
    
    ```
    int s = ((_bits_ >> 63) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
    int e = (int)((_bits_ >> 52) & 0x7ffL);
    long m = (e == 0) ?
               (_bits_ & 0xfffffffffffffL) << 1 :
               (_bits_ & 0xfffffffffffffL) | 0x10000000000000L;
    	  
    ```
    

Then the floating-point value equals the `double` value of the mathematical expression `s · m · 2e-1075`.

### 4.4.6. The `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure is used to represent a field or method, without indicating which class or interface type it belongs to:

```
CONSTANT\_NameAndType\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 name\_index;
    u2 descriptor\_index;
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_NameAndType` (12).

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing either a valid unqualified name denoting a field or method ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")), or the special method name `<init>` ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")).

descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a valid field descriptor or method descriptor ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors"), [§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).

### 4.4.7. The `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure is used to represent constant string values:

```
CONSTANT\_Utf8\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 length;
    u1 bytes\[length\];
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_Utf8` (1).

length

The value of the `length` item gives the number of bytes in the `bytes` array (not the length of the resulting string).

bytes\[\]

The `bytes` array contains the bytes of the string.

No byte may have the value `(byte)0`.

No byte may lie in the range `(byte)0xf0` to `(byte)0xff`.

String content is encoded in modified UTF-8. Modified UTF-8 strings are encoded so that code point sequences that contain only non-null ASCII characters can be represented using only 1 byte per code point, but all code points in the Unicode codespace can be represented. Modified UTF-8 strings are not null-terminated. The encoding is as follows:

*   Code points in the range '`\u0001`' to '`\u007F`' are represented by a single byte:
    
    **Table 4.7.** 
    
    <table class="table" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center" class="c1"> <col align="center" class="c2"> <col align="center" class="c3"> <col align="center" class="c4"> <col align="center" class="c5"> <col align="center" class="c6"> <col align="center" class="c7"> <col align="center" class="c8"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span></td><td colspan="7" align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>bits 6-0</em></span></td></tr></tbody></table>
    
      
    
    The 7 bits of data in the byte give the value of the code point represented.
    
*   The null code point ('`\u0000`') and code points in the range '`\u0080`' to '`\u07FF`' are represented by a pair of bytes `x` and `y` :
    
    **Table 4.8.** 
    
    <table class="table" border="0"><colgroup><col> <col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><code class="literal">x</code>:</td><td><div class="table"><a name="d5e4823"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;4.9.&nbsp;</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table class="table" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center" class="c1"> <col align="center" class="c2"> <col align="center" class="c3"> <col align="center" class="c4"> <col align="center" class="c5"> <col align="center" class="c6"> <col align="center" class="c7"> <col align="center" class="c8"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span></td><td align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span></td><td align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span></td><td colspan="5" align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>bits 10-6</em></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"></td></tr><tr><td><code class="literal">y</code>:</td><td><div class="table"><a name="d5e4847"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;4.10.&nbsp;</b></p><div class="table-contents"><table class="table" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center" class="c1"> <col align="center" class="c2"> <col align="center" class="c3"> <col align="center" class="c4"> <col align="center" class="c5"> <col align="center" class="c6"> <col align="center" class="c7"> <col align="center" class="c8"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span></td><td align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>0</em></span></td><td colspan="6" align="center"><span class="emphasis"><em>bits 5-0</em></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br class="table-break"></td></tr></tbody></table>
    
      
    
    The two bytes represent the code point with the value:
    
    ```
    ((x & 0x1f) << 6) + (y & 0x3f)
        
    ```

    The six bytes represent the code point with the value:
    
    ```
    0x10000 + ((v & 0x0f) << 16) + ((w & 0x3f) << 10) +
    ((y & 0x0f) << 6) + (z & 0x3f)
        
    ```
    

The bytes of multibyte characters are stored in the `class` file in big-endian (high byte first) order.

There are two differences between this format and the "standard" UTF-8 format. First, the null character `(char)0` is encoded using the 2-byte format rather than the 1-byte format, so that modified UTF-8 strings never have embedded nulls. Second, only the 1-byte, 2-byte, and 3-byte formats of standard UTF-8 are used. The Java Virtual Machine does not recognize the four-byte format of standard UTF-8; it uses its own two-times-three-byte format instead.

For more information regarding the standard UTF-8 format, see Section 3.9 _Unicode Encoding Forms_ of _The Unicode Standard, Version 13.0_.

### 4.4.8. The `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure is used to represent a method handle:

```
CONSTANT\_MethodHandle\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u1 reference\_kind;
    u2 reference\_index;
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure are the following:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_MethodHandle` (15).

reference\_kind

The value of the `reference_kind` item must be in the range 1 to 9. The value denotes the _kind_ of this method handle, which characterizes its bytecode behavior ([§5.4.3.5](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.3.5 "5.4.3.5. Method Type and Method Handle Resolution")).

reference\_index

The value of the `reference_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be as follows:

*   If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 1 (`REF_getField`), 2 (`REF_getStatic`), 3 (`REF_putField`), or 4 (`REF_putStatic`), then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure ([§4.4.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2 "4.4.2. The CONSTANT_Fieldref_info, CONSTANT_Methodref_info, and CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info Structures")) representing a field for which a method handle is to be created.
    
*   If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 5 (`REF_invokeVirtual`) or 8 (`REF_newInvokeSpecial`), then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure ([§4.4.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2 "4.4.2. The CONSTANT_Fieldref_info, CONSTANT_Methodref_info, and CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info Structures")) representing a class's method or constructor ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")) for which a method handle is to be created.
    
*   If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 6 (`REF_invokeStatic`) or 7 (`REF_invokeSpecial`), then if the `class` file version number is less than 52.0, the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure representing a class's method for which a method handle is to be created; if the `class` file version number is 52.0 or above, the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be either a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure or a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure ([§4.4.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2 "4.4.2. The CONSTANT_Fieldref_info, CONSTANT_Methodref_info, and CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info Structures")) representing a class's or interface's method for which a method handle is to be created.
    
*   If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 9 (`REF_invokeInterface`), then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure representing an interface's method for which a method handle is to be created.
    

If the value of the `reference_kind` item is 5 (`REF_invokeVirtual`), 6 (`REF_invokeStatic`), 7 (`REF_invokeSpecial`), or 9 (`REF_invokeInterface`), the name of the method represented by a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure or a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure must not be `<init>` or `<clinit>`.

If the value is 8 (`REF_newInvokeSpecial`), the name of the method represented by a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure must be `<init>`.

### 4.4.9. The `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` structure is used to represent a method type:

```
CONSTANT\_MethodType\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 descriptor\_index;
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` structure are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_MethodType` (16).

descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).

### 4.4.10. The `CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` and `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` Structures

Most structures in the `constant_pool` table represent entities directly, by combining names, descriptors, and values recorded statically in the table. In contrast, the `CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` and `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structures represent entities indirectly, by pointing to code which computes an entity dynamically. The code, called a _bootstrap method_, is invoked by the Java Virtual Machine during resolution of symbolic references derived from these structures ([§5.1](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.1 "5.1. The Run-Time Constant Pool"), [§5.4.3.6](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.3.6 "5.4.3.6. Dynamically-Computed Constant and Call Site Resolution")). Each structure specifies a bootstrap method as well as an auxiliary name and type that characterize the entity to be computed. In more detail:

*   The `CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` structure is used to represent a _dynamically-computed constant_, an arbitrary value that is produced by invocation of a bootstrap method in the course of an _ldc_ instruction ([§_ldc_](jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.ldc "ldc")), among others. The auxiliary type specified by the structure constrains the type of the dynamically-computed constant.
    
*   The `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure is used to represent a _dynamically-computed call site_, an instance of `java.lang.invoke.CallSite` that is produced by invocation of a bootstrap method in the course of an _invokedynamic_ instruction ([§_invokedynamic_](jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.invokedynamic "invokedynamic")). The auxiliary type specified by the structure constrains the method type of the dynamically-computed call site.
    

```
CONSTANT\_Dynamic\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 bootstrap\_method\_attr\_index;
    u2 name\_and\_type\_index;
}

CONSTANT\_InvokeDynamic\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 bootstrap\_method\_attr\_index;
    u2 name\_and\_type\_index;
}

```

The items of these structures are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_Dynamic` (17).

The `tag` item of a `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure has the value `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic` (18).

bootstrap\_method\_attr\_index

The value of the `bootstrap_method_attr_index` item must be a valid index into the `bootstrap_methods` array of the bootstrap method table of this `class` file ([§4.7.23](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.23 "4.7.23. The BootstrapMethods Attribute")).

`CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` structures are unique in that they are syntactically allowed to refer to themselves via the bootstrap method table. Rather than mandating that such cycles are detected when classes are loaded (a potentially expensive check), we permit cycles initially but mandate a failure at resolution ([§5.4.3.6](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.3.6 "5.4.3.6. Dynamically-Computed Constant and Call Site Resolution")).

name\_and\_type\_index

The value of the `name_and_type_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure ([§4.4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6 "4.4.6. The CONSTANT_NameAndType_info Structure")). This `constant_pool` entry indicates a name and descriptor.

In a `CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` structure, the indicated descriptor must be a field descriptor ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")).

In a `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure, the indicated descriptor must be a method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).

### 4.4.11. The `CONSTANT_Module_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure is used to represent a module:

```
CONSTANT\_Module\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 name\_index;
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_Module` (19).

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a valid module name ([§4.2.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.3 "4.2.3. Module and Package Names")).

A `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure is permitted only in the constant pool of a `class` file that declares a module, that is, a `ClassFile` structure where the `access_flags` item has the `ACC_MODULE` flag set. In all other `class` files, a `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure is illegal.

### 4.4.12. The `CONSTANT_Package_info` Structure

The `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure is used to represent a package exported or opened by a module:

```
CONSTANT\_Package\_info {
    u1 tag;
    u2 name\_index;
}

```

The items of the `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure are as follows:

tag

The `tag` item has the value `CONSTANT_Package` (20).

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a valid package name encoded in internal form ([§4.2.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.3 "4.2.3. Module and Package Names")).

A `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure is permitted only in the constant pool of a `class` file that declares a module, that is, a `ClassFile` structure where the `access_flags` item has the `ACC_MODULE` flag set. In all other `class` files, a `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure is illegal.

4.5. Fields
-----------

Each field is described by a `field_info` structure.

No two fields in one `class` file may have the same name and descriptor ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")).

The structure has the following format:

```
field\_info {
    u2             access\_flags;
    u2             name\_index;
    u2             descriptor\_index;
    u2             attributes\_count;
    attribute\_info attributes\[attributes\_count\];
}

```

The items of the `field_info` structure are as follows:

access\_flags

The value of the `access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permission to and properties of this field. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is specified in [Table 4.5-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5-200-A.1 "Table 4.5-A. Field access and property flags").

**Table 4.5-A. Field access and property flags**

  
| Flag Name | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACC_PUBLIC` | 0x0001 | Declared `public`; may be accessed from outside its package. |
| `ACC_PRIVATE` | 0x0002 | 
Declared `private`; accessible only within the defining class and other classes belonging to the same nest ([§5.4.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4 "5.4.4. Access Control")).

 |
| `ACC_PROTECTED` | 0x0004 | Declared `protected`; may be accessed within subclasses. |
| `ACC_STATIC` | 0x0008 | Declared `static`. |
| `ACC_FINAL` | 0x0010 | Declared `final`; never directly assigned to after object construction (JLS §17.5). |
| `ACC_VOLATILE` | 0x0040 | Declared `volatile`; cannot be cached. |
| `ACC_TRANSIENT` | 0x0080 | Declared `transient`; not written or read by a persistent object manager. |
| `ACC_SYNTHETIC` | 0x1000 | Declared synthetic; not present in the source code. |
| `ACC_ENUM` | 0x4000 | Declared as an element of an `enum` class. |

  

Fields of classes may set any of the flags in [Table 4.5-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5-200-A.1 "Table 4.5-A. Field access and property flags"). However, each field of a class may have at most one of its `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PRIVATE`, and `ACC_PROTECTED` flags set (JLS §8.3.1), and must not have both its `ACC_FINAL` and `ACC_VOLATILE` flags set (JLS §8.3.1.4).

Fields of interfaces must have their `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_STATIC`, and `ACC_FINAL` flags set; they may have their `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag set and must not have any of the other flags in [Table 4.5-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5-200-A.1 "Table 4.5-A. Field access and property flags") set (JLS §9.3).

The `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag indicates that this field was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code.

The `ACC_ENUM` flag indicates that this field is used to hold an element of an enum class (JLS §8.9).

All bits of the `access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.5-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5-200-A.1 "Table 4.5-A. Field access and property flags") are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) which represents a valid unqualified name denoting a field ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")).

descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) which represents a valid field descriptor ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")).

attributes\_count

The value of the `attributes_count` item indicates the number of additional attributes of this field.

attributes\[\]

Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes")).

A field can have any number of optional attributes associated with it.

The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-320 "Table 4.7-C. Predefined class file attributes (by location)").

The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure are given in [§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes").

The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure are given in [§4.7.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.1 "4.7.1. Defining and Naming New Attributes").

4.6. Methods
------------

Each method, including each instance initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")) and the class or interface initialization method ([§2.9.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.2 "2.9.2. Class Initialization Methods")), is described by a `method_info` structure.

No two methods in one `class` file may have the same name and descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).

The structure has the following format:

```
method\_info {
    u2             access\_flags;
    u2             name\_index;
    u2             descriptor\_index;
    u2             attributes\_count;
    attribute\_info attributes\[attributes\_count\];
}

```

The items of the `method_info` structure are as follows:

access\_flags

The value of the `access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permission to and properties of this method. The interpretation of each flag, when set, is specified in [Table 4.6-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6-200-A.1 "Table 4.6-A. Method access and property flags").

**Table 4.6-A. Method access and property flags**

  
| Flag Name | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACC_PUBLIC` | 0x0001 | Declared `public`; may be accessed from outside its package. |
| `ACC_PRIVATE` | 0x0002 | 
Declared `private`; accessible only within the defining class and other classes belonging to the same nest ([§5.4.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4 "5.4.4. Access Control")).

 |
| `ACC_PROTECTED` | 0x0004 | Declared `protected`; may be accessed within subclasses. |
| `ACC_STATIC` | 0x0008 | Declared `static`. |
| `ACC_FINAL` | 0x0010 | Declared `final`; must not be overridden ([§5.4.5](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.5 "5.4.5. Method Overriding")). |
| `ACC_SYNCHRONIZED` | 0x0020 | Declared `synchronized`; invocation is wrapped by a monitor use. |
| `ACC_BRIDGE` | 0x0040 | A bridge method, generated by the compiler. |
| `ACC_VARARGS` | 0x0080 | Declared with variable number of arguments. |
| `ACC_NATIVE` | 0x0100 | Declared `native`; implemented in a language other than the Java programming language. |
| `ACC_ABSTRACT` | 0x0400 | Declared `abstract`; no implementation is provided. |
| `ACC_STRICT` | 0x0800 | 

In a `class` file whose major version number is at least 46 and at most 60: Declared `strictfp`.

 |
| `ACC_SYNTHETIC` | 0x1000 | Declared synthetic; not present in the source code. |

  

The value 0x0800 is interpreted as the `ACC_STRICT` flag only in a `class` file whose major version number is at least 46 and at most 60. For methods in such a `class` file, the rules below determine whether the `ACC_STRICT` flag may be set in combination with other flags. (Setting the `ACC_STRICT` flag constrained a method's floating-point instructions in Java SE 1.2 through 16 ([§2.8](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.8 "2.8. Floating-Point Arithmetic")).) For methods in a `class` file whose major version number is less than 46 or greater than 60, the value 0x0800 is not interpreted as the `ACC_STRICT` flag, but rather is unassigned; it is not meaningful to "set the `ACC_STRICT` flag" in such a `class` file.

Methods of classes may have any of the flags in [Table 4.6-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6-200-A.1 "Table 4.6-A. Method access and property flags") set. However, each method of a class may have at most one of its `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PRIVATE`, and `ACC_PROTECTED` flags set (JLS §8.4.3).

Methods of interfaces may have any of the flags in [Table 4.6-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6-200-A.1 "Table 4.6-A. Method access and property flags") set except `ACC_PROTECTED`, `ACC_FINAL`, `ACC_SYNCHRONIZED`, and `ACC_NATIVE` (JLS §9.4). In a `class` file whose version number is less than 52.0, each method of an interface must have its `ACC_PUBLIC` and `ACC_ABSTRACT` flags set; in a `class` file whose version number is 52.0 or above, each method of an interface must have exactly one of its `ACC_PUBLIC` and `ACC_PRIVATE` flags set.

If a method of a class or interface has its `ACC_ABSTRACT` flag set, it must not have any of its `ACC_PRIVATE`, `ACC_STATIC`, `ACC_FINAL`, `ACC_SYNCHRONIZED`, or `ACC_NATIVE` flags set, nor (in a `class` file whose major version number is at least 46 and at most 60) have its `ACC_STRICT` flag set.

An instance initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")) may have at most one of its `ACC_PUBLIC`, `ACC_PRIVATE`, and `ACC_PROTECTED` flags set, and may also have its `ACC_VARARGS` and `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flags set, and may also (in a `class` file whose major version number is at least 46 and at most 60) have its `ACC_STRICT` flag set, but must not have any of the other flags in [Table 4.6-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6-200-A.1 "Table 4.6-A. Method access and property flags") set.

In a `class` file whose version number is 51.0 or above, a method whose name is `<clinit>` must have its `ACC_STATIC` flag set.

A class or interface initialization method ([§2.9.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.2 "2.9.2. Class Initialization Methods")) is called implicitly by the Java Virtual Machine. The value of its `access_flags` item is ignored except for the setting of the `ACC_STATIC` flag and (in a `class` file whose major version number is at least 46 and at most 60) the `ACC_STRICT` flag, and the method is exempt from the preceding rules about legal combinations of flags.

The `ACC_BRIDGE` flag is used to indicate a bridge method generated by a compiler for the Java programming language.

The `ACC_VARARGS` flag indicates that this method takes a variable number of arguments at the source code level. A method declared to take a variable number of arguments must be compiled with the `ACC_VARARGS` flag set to 1. All other methods must be compiled with the `ACC_VARARGS` flag set to 0.

The `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag indicates that this method was generated by a compiler and does not appear in source code, unless it is one of the methods named in [§4.7.8](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.8 "4.7.8. The Synthetic Attribute").

All bits of the `access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.6-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6-200-A.1 "Table 4.6-A. Method access and property flags") are reserved for future use. (This includes the bit corresponding to 0x0800 in a `class` file whose major version number is less than 46 or greater than 60.) They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing either a valid unqualified name denoting a method ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")), or (if this method is in a class rather than an interface) the special method name `<init>`, or the special method name `<clinit>`.

descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a valid method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")). Furthermore:

*   If this method is in a class rather than an interface, and the name of the method is `<init>`, then the descriptor must denote a `void` method.
    
*   If the name of the method is `<clinit>`, then the descriptor must denote a `void` method, and, in a `class` file whose version number is 51.0 or above, a method that takes no arguments.
    

A future edition of this specification may require that the last parameter descriptor of the method descriptor is an array type if the `ACC_VARARGS` flag is set in the `access_flags` item.

attributes\_count

The value of the `attributes_count` item indicates the number of additional attributes of this method.

attributes\[\]

Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes")).

A method can have any number of optional attributes associated with it.

The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-320 "Table 4.7-C. Predefined class file attributes (by location)").

The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure are given in [§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes").

The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure are given in [§4.7.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.1 "4.7.1. Defining and Naming New Attributes").

4.7. Attributes
---------------

_Attributes_ are used in the `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, `Code_attribute`, and `record_component_info` structures of the `class` file format ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods"), [§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute"), [§4.7.30](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.30 "4.7.30. The Record Attribute")).

All attributes have the following general format:

```
attribute\_info {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u1 info\[attribute\_length\];
}

```

For all attributes, the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid unsigned 16-bit index into the constant pool of the class. The `constant_pool` entry at `attribute_name_index` must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the name of the attribute. The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the subsequent information in bytes. The length does not include the initial six bytes that contain the `attribute_name_index` and `attribute_length` items.

30 attributes are predefined by this specification. They are listed three times, for ease of navigation:

*   [Table 4.7-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-300 "Table 4.7-A. Predefined class file attributes (by section)") is ordered by the attributes' section numbers in this chapter. Each attribute is shown with the first version of the `class` file format in which it was defined. Also shown is the version of the Java SE Platform which introduced that version of the `class` file format ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")).
    
*   [Table 4.7-B](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-310 "Table 4.7-B. Predefined class file attributes (by class file format)") is ordered by the first version of the `class` file format in which each attribute was defined.
    
*   [Table 4.7-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-320 "Table 4.7-C. Predefined class file attributes (by location)") is ordered by the location in a `class` file where each attribute is defined to appear.
    

Within the context of their use in this specification, that is, in the `attributes` tables of the `class` file structures in which they appear, the names of these predefined attributes are reserved.

Any conditions on the presence of a predefined attribute in an `attributes` table are specified explicitly in the section which describes the attribute. If no conditions are specified, then the attribute may appear any number of times in an `attributes` table.

The predefined attributes are categorized into three groups according to their purpose:

1.  Seven attributes are critical to correct interpretation of the `class` file by the Java Virtual Machine:
    
    *   `ConstantValue`
        
    *   `Code`
        
    *   `StackMapTable`
        
    *   `BootstrapMethods`
        
    *   `NestHost`
        
    *   `NestMembers`
        
    *   `PermittedSubclasses`
        
    
    In a `class` file whose version number is _v_, each of these attributes must be recognized and correctly read by an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine if the implementation supports version _v_ of the `class` file format, and the attribute was first defined in version _v_ or earlier of the `class` file format, and the attribute appears in a location where it is defined to appear.
    
2.  Ten attributes are not critical to correct interpretation of the `class` file by the Java Virtual Machine, but are either critical to correct interpretation of the `class` file by the class libraries of the Java SE Platform, or are useful for tools (in which case the section that specifies an attribute describes it as "optional"):
    
    *   `Exceptions`
        
    *   `InnerClasses`
        
    *   `EnclosingMethod`
        
    *   `Synthetic`
        
    *   `Signature`
        
    *   `Record`
        
    *   `SourceFile`
        
    *   `LineNumberTable`
        
    *   `LocalVariableTable`
        
    *   `LocalVariableTypeTable`
        
    
    In a `class` file whose version number is _v_, each of these attributes must be recognized and correctly read by an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine if the implementation supports version _v_ of the `class` file format, and the attribute was first defined in version _v_ or earlier of the `class` file format, and the attribute appears in a location where it is defined to appear.
    
3.  Thirteen attributes are not critical to correct interpretation of the `class` file by the Java Virtual Machine, but contain metadata about the `class` file that is either exposed by the class libraries of the Java SE Platform, or made available by tools (in which case the section that specifies an attribute describes it as "optional"):
    
    *   `SourceDebugExtension`
        
    *   `Deprecated`
        
    *   `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations`
        
    *   `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations`
        
    *   `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations`
        
    *   `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations`
        
    *   `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations`
        
    *   `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations`
        
    *   `AnnotationDefault`
        
    *   `MethodParameters`
        
    *   `Module`
        
    *   `ModulePackages`
        
    *   `ModuleMainClass`
        
    
    An implementation of the Java Virtual Machine may use the information that these attributes contain, or otherwise must silently ignore these attributes.

### 4.7.1. Defining and Naming New Attributes

Compilers are permitted to define and emit `class` files containing new attributes in the `attributes` tables of `class` file structures, `field_info` structures, `method_info` structures, and `Code` attributes ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). Java Virtual Machine implementations are permitted to recognize and use new attributes found in these `attributes` tables. However, any attribute not defined as part of this specification must not affect the semantics of the `class` file. Java Virtual Machine implementations are required to silently ignore attributes they do not recognize.

For instance, defining a new attribute to support vendor-specific debugging is permitted. Because Java Virtual Machine implementations are required to ignore attributes they do not recognize, `class` files intended for that particular Java Virtual Machine implementation will be usable by other implementations even if those implementations cannot make use of the additional debugging information that the `class` files contain.

Java Virtual Machine implementations are specifically prohibited from throwing an exception or otherwise refusing to use `class` files simply because of the presence of some new attribute. Of course, tools operating on `class` files may not run correctly if given `class` files that do not contain all the attributes they require.

Two attributes that are intended to be distinct, but that happen to use the same attribute name and are of the same length, will conflict on implementations that recognize either attribute. Attributes defined other than in this specification should have names chosen according to the package naming convention described in _The Java Language Specification, Java SE 19 Edition_ (JLS §6.1).

Future versions of this specification may define additional attributes.

### 4.7.2. The `ConstantValue` Attribute

The `ConstantValue` attribute is a fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure ([§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields")). A `ConstantValue` attribute represents the value of a constant expression (JLS §15.28), and is used as follows:

*   If the `ACC_STATIC` flag in the `access_flags` item of the `field_info` structure is set, then the field represented by the `field_info` structure is assigned the value represented by its `ConstantValue` attribute as part of the initialization of the class or interface declaring the field ([§5.5](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.5 "5.5. Initialization")). This occurs prior to the invocation of the class or interface initialization method of that class or interface ([§2.9.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.2 "2.9.2. Class Initialization Methods")).
    
*   Otherwise, the Java Virtual Machine must silently ignore the attribute.
    

There may be at most one `ConstantValue` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `field_info` structure.

The `ConstantValue` attribute has the following format:

```
ConstantValue\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 constantvalue\_index;
}

```

The items of the `ConstantValue_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`ConstantValue`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be two.

constantvalue\_index

The value of the `constantvalue_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index gives the value represented by this attribute. The `constant_pool` entry must be of a type appropriate to the field, as specified in [Table 4.7.2-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.2-300-C.1 "Table 4.7.2-A. Constant value attribute types").

**Table 4.7.2-A. Constant value attribute types**

 
| Field Type | Entry Type |
| --- | --- |
| `int`, `short`, `char`, `byte`, `boolean` | `CONSTANT_Integer` |
| `float` | `CONSTANT_Float` |
| `long` | `CONSTANT_Long` |
| `double` | `CONSTANT_Double` |
| `String` | `CONSTANT_String` |

  

### 4.7.3. The `Code` Attribute

The `Code` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure ([§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")). A `Code` attribute contains the Java Virtual Machine instructions and auxiliary information for a method, including an instance initialization method and a class or interface initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods"), [§2.9.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.2 "2.9.2. Class Initialization Methods")).

If the method is either `native` or `abstract`, and is not a class or interface initialization method, then its `method_info` structure must not have a `Code` attribute in its `attributes` table. Otherwise, its `method_info` structure must have exactly one `Code` attribute in its `attributes` table.

The `Code` attribute has the following format:

```
Code\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 max\_stack;
    u2 max\_locals;
    u4 code\_length;
    u1 code\[code\_length\];
    u2 exception\_table\_length;
    {   u2 start\_pc;
        u2 end\_pc;
        u2 handler\_pc;
        u2 catch\_type;
    } exception\_table\[exception\_table\_length\];
    u2 attributes\_count;
    attribute\_info attributes\[attributes\_count\];
}

```

The items of the `Code_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`Code`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

max\_stack

The value of the `max_stack` item gives the maximum depth of the operand stack of this method ([§2.6.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6.2 "2.6.2. Operand Stacks")) at any point during execution of the method.

max\_locals

The value of the `max_locals` item gives the number of local variables in the local variable array allocated upon invocation of this method ([§2.6.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6.1 "2.6.1. Local Variables")), including the local variables used to pass parameters to the method on its invocation.

The greatest local variable index for a value of type `long` or `double` is `max_locals - 2`. The greatest local variable index for a value of any other type is `max_locals - 1`.

code\_length

The value of the `code_length` item gives the number of bytes in the `code` array for this method.

The value of `code_length` must be greater than zero (as the `code` array must not be empty) and less than 65536.

code\[\]

The `code` array gives the actual bytes of Java Virtual Machine code that implement the method.

When the `code` array is read into memory on a byte-addressable machine, if the first byte of the array is aligned on a 4-byte boundary, the _tableswitch_ and _lookupswitch_ 32-bit offsets will be 4-byte aligned. (Refer to the descriptions of those instructions for more information on the consequences of `code` array alignment.)

The detailed constraints on the contents of the `code` array are extensive and are given in a separate section ([§4.9](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.9 "4.9. Constraints on Java Virtual Machine Code")).

exception\_table\_length

The value of the `exception_table_length` item gives the number of entries in the `exception_table` array.

exception\_table\[\]

Each entry in the `exception_table` array describes one exception handler in the `code` array. The order of the handlers in the `exception_table` array is significant ([§2.10](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.10 "2.10. Exceptions")).

Each `exception_table` entry contains the following four items:

start\_pc, end\_pc

The values of the two items `start_pc` and `end_pc` indicate the ranges in the `code` array at which the exception handler is active. The value of `start_pc` must be a valid index into the `code` array of the opcode of an instruction. The value of `end_pc` either must be a valid index into the `code` array of the opcode of an instruction or must be equal to `code_length`, the length of the `code` array. The value of `start_pc` must be less than the value of `end_pc`.

The `start_pc` is inclusive and `end_pc` is exclusive; that is, the exception handler must be active while the program counter is within the interval \[`start_pc`, `end_pc`).

The fact that `end_pc` is exclusive is a historical mistake in the design of the Java Virtual Machine: if the Java Virtual Machine code for a method is exactly 65535 bytes long and ends with an instruction that is 1 byte long, then that instruction cannot be protected by an exception handler. A compiler writer can work around this bug by limiting the maximum size of the generated Java Virtual Machine code for any method, instance initialization method, or static initializer (the size of any code array) to 65534 bytes.

handler\_pc

The value of the `handler_pc` item indicates the start of the exception handler. The value of the item must be a valid index into the `code` array and must be the index of the opcode of an instruction.

catch\_type

If the value of the `catch_type` item is nonzero, it must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing a class of exceptions that this exception handler is designated to catch. The exception handler will be called only if the thrown exception is an instance of the given class or one of its subclasses.

The verifier checks that the class is `Throwable` or a subclass of `Throwable` ([§4.9.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.9.2 "4.9.2. Structural Constraints")).

If the value of the `catch_type` item is zero, this exception handler is called for all exceptions.

This is used to implement `finally` ([§3.13](jvms-3.html#jvms-3.13 "3.13. Compiling finally")).

attributes\_count

The value of the `attributes_count` item indicates the number of attributes of the `Code` attribute.

attributes\[\]

Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes")).

A `Code` attribute can have any number of optional attributes associated with it.

The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute are listed in [Table 4.7-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-320 "Table 4.7-C. Predefined class file attributes (by location)").

The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute are given in [§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes").

The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute are given in [§4.7.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.1 "4.7.1. Defining and Naming New Attributes").

### 4.7.4. The `StackMapTable` Attribute

The `StackMapTable` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). A `StackMapTable` attribute is used during the process of verification by type checking ([§4.10.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1 "4.10.1. Verification by Type Checking")).

There may be at most one `StackMapTable` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute.

In a `class` file whose version number is 50.0 or above, if a method's `Code` attribute does not have a `StackMapTable` attribute, it has an _implicit stack map attribute_ ([§4.10.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1 "4.10.1. Verification by Type Checking")). This implicit stack map attribute is equivalent to a `StackMapTable` attribute with `number_of_entries` equal to zero.

The `StackMapTable` attribute has the following format:

```
StackMapTable\_attribute {
    u2              attribute\_name\_index;
    u4              attribute\_length;
    u2              number\_of\_entries;
    stack\_map\_frame entries\[number\_of\_entries\];
}

```

The items of the `StackMapTable_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`StackMapTable`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

number\_of\_entries

The value of the `number_of_entries` item gives the number of `stack_map_frame` entries in the `entries` table.

entries\[\]

Each entry in the `entries` table describes one stack map frame of the method. The order of the stack map frames in the `entries` table is significant.

A _stack map frame_ specifies (either explicitly or implicitly) the bytecode offset at which it applies, and the verification types of local variables and operand stack entries for that offset.

Each stack map frame described in the `entries` table relies on the previous frame for some of its semantics. The first stack map frame of a method is implicit, and computed from the method descriptor by the type checker ([§4.10.1.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.6 "4.10.1.6. Type Checking Methods with Code")). The `stack_map_frame` structure at `entries[0]` therefore describes the second stack map frame of the method.

The _bytecode offset_ at which a stack map frame applies is calculated by taking the value `offset_delta` specified in the frame (either explicitly or implicitly), and adding `offset_delta + 1` to the bytecode offset of the previous frame, unless the previous frame is the initial frame of the method. In that case, the bytecode offset at which the stack map frame applies is the value `offset_delta` specified in the frame.

By using an offset delta rather than storing the actual bytecode offset, we ensure, by definition, that stack map frames are in the correctly sorted order. Furthermore, by consistently using the formula `offset_delta + 1` for all explicit frames (as opposed to the implicit first frame), we guarantee the absence of duplicates.

We say that an instruction in the bytecode has a _corresponding stack map frame_ if the instruction starts at offset _i_ in the `code` array of a `Code` attribute, and the `Code` attribute has a `StackMapTable` attribute whose `entries` array contains a stack map frame that applies at bytecode offset _i_.

A _verification type_ specifies the type of either one or two locations, where a _location_ is either a single local variable or a single operand stack entry. A verification type is represented by a discriminated union, `verification_type_info`, that consists of a one-byte tag, indicating which item of the union is in use, followed by zero or more bytes, giving more information about the tag.

```
union verification\_type\_info {
    Top\_variable\_info;
    Integer\_variable\_info;
    Float\_variable\_info;
    Long\_variable\_info;
    Double\_variable\_info;
    Null\_variable\_info;
    UninitializedThis\_variable\_info;
    Object\_variable\_info;
    Uninitialized\_variable\_info;
}

```

A verification type that specifies one location in the local variable array or in the operand stack is represented by the following items of the `verification_type_info` union:

*   The `Top_variable_info` item indicates that the local variable has the verification type `top`.
    
    ```
    Top\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Top; /\* 0 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `Integer_variable_info` item indicates that the location has the verification type `int`.
    
    ```
    Integer\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Integer; /\* 1 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `Float_variable_info` item indicates that the location has the verification type `float`.
    
    ```
    Float\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Float; /\* 2 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `Null_variable_info` type indicates that the location has the verification type `null`.
    
    ```
    Null\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Null; /\* 5 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `UninitializedThis_variable_info` item indicates that the location has the verification type `uninitializedThis`.
    
    ```
    UninitializedThis\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_UninitializedThis; /\* 6 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `Object_variable_info` item indicates that the location has the verification type which is the class represented by the `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) found in the `constant_pool` table at the index given by `cpool_index`.
    
    ```
    Object\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Object; /\* 7 \*/
        u2 cpool\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `Uninitialized_variable_info` item indicates that the location has the verification type `uninitialized(Offset)`. The `Offset` item indicates the offset, in the `code` array of the `Code` attribute that contains this `StackMapTable` attribute, of the _new_ instruction ([§_new_](jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5.new "new")) that created the object being stored in the location.
    
    ```
    Uninitialized\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Uninitialized; /\* 8 \*/
        u2 offset;
    }
        
    ```
    

A verification type that specifies two locations in the local variable array or in the operand stack is represented by the following items of the `verification_type_info` union:

*   The `Long_variable_info` item indicates that the first of two locations has the verification type `long`.
    
    ```
    Long\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Long; /\* 4 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `Double_variable_info` item indicates that the first of two locations has the verification type `double`.
    
    ```
    Double\_variable\_info {
        u1 tag = ITEM\_Double; /\* 3 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The `Long_variable_info` and `Double_variable_info` items indicate the verification type of the second of two locations as follows:
    
    *   If the first of the two locations is a local variable, then:
        
        *   It must not be the local variable with the highest index.
            
        *   The next higher numbered local variable has the verification type `top`.
            
        
    *   If the first of the two locations is an operand stack entry, then:
        
        *   It must not be the topmost location of the operand stack.
            
        *   The next location closer to the top of the operand stack has the verification type `top`.
            
        
    

A stack map frame is represented by a discriminated union, `stack_map_frame`, which consists of a one-byte tag, indicating which item of the union is in use, followed by zero or more bytes, giving more information about the tag.

```
union stack\_map\_frame {
    same\_frame;
    same\_locals\_1\_stack\_item\_frame;
    same\_locals\_1\_stack\_item\_frame\_extended;
    chop\_frame;
    same\_frame\_extended;
    append\_frame;
    full\_frame;
}

```

The tag indicates the _frame type_ of the stack map frame:

*   The frame type `same_frame` is represented by tags in the range \[0-63\]. This frame type indicates that the frame has exactly the same local variables as the previous frame and that the operand stack is empty. The `offset_delta` value for the frame is the value of the tag item, `frame_type`.
    
    ```
    same\_frame {
        u1 frame\_type = SAME; /\* 0-63 \*/
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The frame type `same_locals_1_stack_item_frame` is represented by tags in the range \[64, 127\]. This frame type indicates that the frame has exactly the same local variables as the previous frame and that the operand stack has one entry. The `offset_delta` value for the frame is given by the formula `frame_type - 64`. The verification type of the one stack entry appears after the frame type.
    
    ```
    same\_locals\_1\_stack\_item\_frame {
        u1 frame\_type = SAME\_LOCALS\_1\_STACK\_ITEM; /\* 64-127 \*/
        verification\_type\_info stack\[1\];
    }
    
    ```
    
*   Tags in the range \[128-246\] are reserved for future use.
    
*   The frame type `same_locals_1_stack_item_frame_extended` is represented by the tag 247. This frame type indicates that the frame has exactly the same local variables as the previous frame and that the operand stack has one entry. The `offset_delta` value for the frame is given explicitly, unlike in the frame type `same_locals_1_stack_item_frame`. The verification type of the one stack entry appears after `offset_delta`.
    
    ```
    same\_locals\_1\_stack\_item\_frame\_extended {
        u1 frame\_type = SAME\_LOCALS\_1\_STACK\_ITEM\_EXTENDED; /\* 247 \*/
        u2 offset\_delta;
        verification\_type\_info stack\[1\];
    }
        
    ```
    
*   The frame type `chop_frame` is represented by tags in the range \[248-250\]. This frame type indicates that the frame has the same local variables as the previous frame except that the last _k_ local variables are absent, and that the operand stack is empty. The value of _k_ is given by the formula `251 - frame_type`. The `offset_delta` value for the frame is given explicitly.
    
    ```
    chop\_frame {
        u1 frame\_type = CHOP; /\* 248-250 \*/
        u2 offset\_delta;
    }
        
    ```
    
    Assume the verification types of local variables in the previous frame are given by `locals`, an array structured as in the `full_frame` frame type. If `locals[M-1]` in the previous frame represented local variable X and `locals[M]` represented local variable Y, then the effect of removing one local variable is that `locals[M-1]` in the new frame represents local variable X and `locals[M]` is undefined.
    
    It is an error if _k_ is larger than the number of local variables in `locals` for the previous frame, that is, if the number of local variables in the new frame would be less than zero.
    
*   The frame type `same_frame_extended` is represented by the tag 251. This frame type indicates that the frame has exactly the same local variables as the previous frame and that the operand stack is empty. The `offset_delta` value for the frame is given explicitly, unlike in the frame type `same_frame`.
    
    ```
    same\_frame\_extended {
        u1 frame\_type = SAME\_FRAME\_EXTENDED; /\* 251 \*/
        u2 offset\_delta;
    }
       
    ```
    
*   The frame type `append_frame` is represented by tags in the range \[252-254\]. This frame type indicates that the frame has the same locals as the previous frame except that _k_ additional locals are defined, and that the operand stack is empty. The value of _k_ is given by the formula `frame_type - 251`. The `offset_delta` value for the frame is given explicitly.
    
    ```
    append\_frame {
        u1 frame\_type = APPEND; /\* 252-254 \*/
        u2 offset\_delta;
        verification\_type\_info locals\[frame\_type - 251\];
    }
        
    ```
    
    The 0th entry in `locals` represents the verification type of the first additional local variable. If `locals[M]` represents local variable `N`, then:
    
    *   `locals[M+1]` represents local variable `N+1` if `locals[M]` is one of `Top_variable_info`, `Integer_variable_info`, `Float_variable_info`, `Null_variable_info`, `UninitializedThis_variable_info`, `Object_variable_info`, or `Uninitialized_variable_info`; and
        
    *   `locals[M+1]` represents local variable `N+2` if `locals[M]` is either `Long_variable_info` or `Double_variable_info`.
        
    
    It is an error if, for any index _i_, `locals[_i_]` represents a local variable whose index is greater than the maximum number of local variables for the method.
    
*   The frame type `full_frame` is represented by the tag 255. The `offset_delta` value for the frame is given explicitly.
    
    ```
    full\_frame {
        u1 frame\_type = FULL\_FRAME; /\* 255 \*/
        u2 offset\_delta;
        u2 number\_of\_locals;
        verification\_type\_info locals\[number\_of\_locals\];
        u2 number\_of\_stack\_items;
        verification\_type\_info stack\[number\_of\_stack\_items\];
    }
        
    ```
    
    The 0th entry in `locals` represents the verification type of local variable 0. If `locals[M]` represents local variable `N`, then:
    
    *   `locals[M+1]` represents local variable `N+1` if `locals[M]` is one of `Top_variable_info`, `Integer_variable_info`, `Float_variable_info`, `Null_variable_info`, `UninitializedThis_variable_info`, `Object_variable_info`, or `Uninitialized_variable_info`; and
        
    *   `locals[M+1]` represents local variable `N+2` if `locals[M]` is either `Long_variable_info` or `Double_variable_info`.
        
    
    It is an error if, for any index _i_, `locals[_i_]` represents a local variable whose index is greater than the maximum number of local variables for the method.
    
    The 0th entry in `stack` represents the verification type of the bottom of the operand stack, and subsequent entries in `stack` represent the verification types of stack entries closer to the top of the operand stack. We refer to the bottom of the operand stack as stack entry 0, and to subsequent entries of the operand stack as stack entry 1, 2, etc. If `stack[M]` represents stack entry `N`, then:
    
    *   `stack[M+1]` represents stack entry `N+1` if `stack[M]` is one of `Top_variable_info`, `Integer_variable_info`, `Float_variable_info`, `Null_variable_info`, `UninitializedThis_variable_info`, `Object_variable_info`, or `Uninitialized_variable_info`; and
        
    *   `stack[M+1]` represents stack entry `N+2` if `stack[M]` is either `Long_variable_info` or `Double_variable_info`.
        
    
    It is an error if, for any index _i_, `stack[_i_]` represents a stack entry whose index is greater than the maximum operand stack size for the method.
    

### 4.7.5. The `Exceptions` Attribute

The `Exceptions` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure ([§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")). The `Exceptions` attribute indicates which checked exceptions a method may throw.

There may be at most one `Exceptions` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure.

The `Exceptions` attribute has the following format:

```
Exceptions\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 number\_of\_exceptions;
    u2 exception\_index\_table\[number\_of\_exceptions\];
}

```

The items of the `Exceptions_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be the `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`Exceptions`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

number\_of\_exceptions

The value of the `number_of_exceptions` item indicates the number of entries in the `exception_index_table`.

exception\_index\_table\[\]

Each value in the `exception_index_table` array must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing a class type that this method is declared to throw.

A method should throw an exception only if at least one of the following three criteria is met:

*   The exception is an instance of `RuntimeException` or one of its subclasses.
    
*   The exception is an instance of `Error` or one of its subclasses.
    
*   The exception is an instance of one of the exception classes specified in the `exception_index_table` just described, or one of their subclasses.
    

These requirements are not enforced in the Java Virtual Machine; they are enforced only at compile time.

### 4.7.6. The `InnerClasses` Attribute

The `InnerClasses` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")).

If the constant pool of a class or interface C contains at least one `CONSTANT_Class_info` entry ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) which represents a class or interface that is not a member of a package, then there must be exactly one `InnerClasses` attribute in the `attributes` table of the `ClassFile` structure for C.

The `InnerClasses` attribute has the following format:

```
InnerClasses\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 number\_of\_classes;
    {   u2 inner\_class\_info\_index;
        u2 outer\_class\_info\_index;
        u2 inner\_name\_index;
        u2 inner\_class\_access\_flags;
    } classes\[number\_of\_classes\];
}

```

The items of the `InnerClasses_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`InnerClasses`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

number\_of\_classes

The value of the `number_of_classes` item indicates the number of entries in the `classes` array.

classes\[\]

Every `CONSTANT_Class_info` entry in the `constant_pool` table which represents a class or interface C that is not a package member must have exactly one corresponding entry in the `classes` array.

If a class or interface has members that are classes or interfaces, its `constant_pool` table (and hence its `InnerClasses` attribute) must refer to each such member (JLS §13.1), even if that member is not otherwise mentioned by the class.

In addition, the `constant_pool` table of every nested class and nested interface must refer to its enclosing class, so altogether, every nested class and nested interface will have `InnerClasses` information for each enclosing class and for each of its own nested classes and interfaces.

Each entry in the `classes` array contains the following four items:

inner\_class\_info\_index

The value of the `inner_class_info_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing C.

outer\_class\_info\_index

If C is not a member of a class or an interface - that is, if C is a top-level class or interface (JLS §7.6) or a local class (JLS §14.3) or an anonymous class (JLS §15.9.5) - then the value of the `outer_class_info_index` item must be zero.

Otherwise, the value of the `outer_class_info_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table, and the entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing the class or interface of which C is a member. The value of the `outer_class_info_index` item must not equal the the value of the `inner_class_info_index` item.

inner\_name\_index

If C is anonymous (JLS §15.9.5), the value of the `inner_name_index` item must be zero.

Otherwise, the value of the `inner_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table, and the entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure that represents the original simple name of C, as given in the source code from which this `class` file was compiled.

inner\_class\_access\_flags

The value of the `inner_class_access_flags` item is a mask of flags used to denote access permissions to and properties of class or interface C as declared in the source code from which this `class` file was compiled. It is used by a compiler to recover the original information when source code is not available. The flags are specified in [Table 4.7.6-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.6-300-D.1-D.1 "Table 4.7.6-A. Nested class access and property flags").

**Table 4.7.6-A. Nested class access and property flags**

  
| Flag Name | Value | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ACC_PUBLIC` | 0x0001 | Marked or implicitly `public` in source. |
| `ACC_PRIVATE` | 0x0002 | Marked `private` in source. |
| `ACC_PROTECTED` | 0x0004 | Marked `protected` in source. |
| `ACC_STATIC` | 0x0008 | Marked or implicitly `static` in source. |
| `ACC_FINAL` | 0x0010 | Marked or implicitly `final` in source. |
| `ACC_INTERFACE` | 0x0200 | Was an `interface` in source. |
| `ACC_ABSTRACT` | 0x0400 | Marked or implicitly `abstract` in source. |
| `ACC_SYNTHETIC` | 0x1000 | Declared synthetic; not present in the source code. |
| `ACC_ANNOTATION` | 0x2000 | Declared as an annotation interface. |
| `ACC_ENUM` | 0x4000 | Declared as an `enum` class. |

  

All bits of the `inner_class_access_flags` item not assigned in [Table 4.7.6-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.6-300-D.1-D.1 "Table 4.7.6-A. Nested class access and property flags") are reserved for future use. They should be set to zero in generated `class` files and should be ignored by Java Virtual Machine implementations.

If a `class` file has a version number that is 51.0 or above, and has an `InnerClasses` attribute in its `attributes` table, then for all entries in the `classes` array of the `InnerClasses` attribute, the value of the `outer_class_info_index` item must be zero if the value of the `inner_name_index` item is zero.

Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation does not check the consistency of an `InnerClasses` attribute against a `class` file representing a class or interface referenced by the attribute.

### 4.7.7. The `EnclosingMethod` Attribute

The `EnclosingMethod` attribute is a fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). A class must have an `EnclosingMethod` attribute if and only if it represents a local class or an anonymous class (JLS §14.3, JLS §15.9.5).

There may be at most one `EnclosingMethod` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `EnclosingMethod` attribute has the following format:

```
EnclosingMethod\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 class\_index;
    u2 method\_index;
}

```

The items of the `EnclosingMethod_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`EnclosingMethod`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be four.

class\_index

The value of the `class_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing the innermost class that encloses the declaration of the current class.

method\_index

If the current class is not immediately enclosed by a method or constructor, then the value of the `method_index` item must be zero.

In particular, `method_index` must be zero if the current class was immediately enclosed in source code by an instance initializer, static initializer, instance variable initializer, or class variable initializer. (The first two concern both local classes and anonymous classes, while the last two concern anonymous classes declared on the right hand side of a field assignment.)

Otherwise, the value of the `method_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure ([§4.4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.6 "4.4.6. The CONSTANT_NameAndType_info Structure")) representing the name and type of a method in the class referenced by the `class_index` attribute above.

It is the responsibility of a Java compiler to ensure that the method identified via the `method_index` is indeed the closest lexically enclosing method of the class that contains this `EnclosingMethod` attribute.

### 4.7.8. The `Synthetic` Attribute

The `Synthetic` attribute is a fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, or `method_info` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")). A class member that does not appear in the source code must be marked using a `Synthetic` attribute, or else it must have its `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag set. The only exceptions to this requirement are compiler-generated members which are not considered implementation artifacts, namely:

*   an instance initialization method representing a default constructor of the Java programming language ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods"))
    
*   a class or interface initialization method ([§2.9.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.2 "2.9.2. Class Initialization Methods"))
    
*   the implicitly declared members of enum and record classes (JLS §8.9.3, JLS §8.10.3)
    

The `Synthetic` attribute was introduced in JDK 1.1 to support nested classes and interfaces.

It is a limitation of the `class` file format that only formal parameters and modules can be flagged as `ACC_MANDATED` ([§4.7.24](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.24 "4.7.24. The MethodParameters Attribute"), [§4.7.25](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.25 "4.7.25. The Module Attribute")) to indicate that, despite being compiler-generated, they are not considered implementation artifacts. There is no way to flag other compiler-generated constructs so that they too are not considered implementation artifacts (JLS §13.1). This limitation means that reflective APIs of the Java SE Platform may not accurately indicate the "mandated" status of such constructs.

The `Synthetic` attribute has the following format:

```
Synthetic\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
}

```

The items of the `Synthetic_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`Synthetic`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be zero.

### 4.7.9. The `Signature` Attribute

The `Signature` attribute is a fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods"), [§4.7.30](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.30 "4.7.30. The Record Attribute")). A `Signature` attribute stores a signature ([§4.7.9.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.9.1 "4.7.9.1. Signatures")) for a class, interface, constructor, method, field, or record component whose declaration in the Java programming language uses type variables or parameterized types. See _The Java Language Specification, Java SE 19 Edition_ for details about these constructs.

There may be at most one `Signature` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure.

The `Signature` attribute has the following format:

```
Signature\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 signature\_index;
}

```

The items of the `Signature_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`Signature`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be two.

signature\_index

The value of the `signature_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a class signature if this `Signature` attribute is an attribute of a `ClassFile` structure; a method signature if this `Signature` attribute is an attribute of a `method_info` structure; or a field signature otherwise.

Oracle's Java Virtual Machine implementation does not check the well-formedness of `Signature` attributes during class loading or linking. Instead, `Signature` attributes are checked by methods of the Java SE Platform class libraries which expose generic signatures of classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields. Examples include `getGenericSuperclass` in `Class` and `toGenericString` in `java.lang.reflect.Executable`.

#### 4.7.9.1. Signatures

_Signatures_ encode declarations written in the Java programming language that use types outside the type system of the Java Virtual Machine. They support reflection and debugging, as well as compilation when only `class` files are available.

A Java compiler must emit a signature for any class, interface, constructor, method, field, or record component whose declaration uses type variables or parameterized types. Specifically, a Java compiler must emit:

*   A class signature for any class or interface declaration which is either generic, or has a parameterized type as a superclass or superinterface, or both.
    
*   A method signature for any method or constructor declaration which is either generic, or has a type variable or parameterized type as the return type or a formal parameter type, or has a type variable in a `throws` clause, or any combination thereof.
    
    If the `throws` clause of a method or constructor declaration does not involve type variables, then a compiler may treat the declaration as having no `throws` clause for the purpose of emitting a method signature.
    
*   A field signature for any field, formal parameter, local variable, or record component declaration whose type uses a type variable or a parameterized type.
    

Signatures are specified using a grammar which follows the notation of [§4.3.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.1 "4.3.1. Grammar Notation"). In addition to that notation:

*   The syntax _\[x\]_ on the right-hand side of a production denotes zero or one occurrences of _x_. That is, _x_ is an _optional symbol_. The alternative which contains the optional symbol actually defines two alternatives: one that omits the optional symbol and one that includes it.
    
*   A very long right-hand side may be continued on a second line by clearly indenting the second line.
    

The grammar includes the terminal symbol _Identifier_ to denote the name of a type, field, method, formal parameter, local variable, or type variable, as generated by a Java compiler. Such a name must not contain any of the ASCII characters `.` `;` `[` `/` `<` `>` `:` (that is, the characters forbidden in method names ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")) and also colon) but may contain characters that must not appear in an identifier in the Java programming language (JLS §3.8).

Signatures rely on a hierarchy of nonterminals known as _type signatures_:

*   A _Java type signature_ represents either a reference type or a primitive type of the Java programming language.
    
    JavaTypeSignature:
    
    [ReferenceTypeSignature](jvms-4.html#jvms-ReferenceTypeSignature "ReferenceTypeSignature")

    (one of)  
    `B` `C` `D` `F` `I` `J` `S` `Z`
    
*   A _reference type signature_ represents a reference type of the Java programming language, that is, a class or interface type, a type variable, or an array type.
    
    A _class type signature_ represents a (possibly parameterized) class or interface type. A class type signature must be formulated such that it can be reliably mapped to the binary name of the class it denotes by erasing any type arguments and converting each `.` character to a `$` character.
    
    A _type variable signature_ represents a type variable.
    
    An _array type signature_ represents one dimension of an array type.

A _class signature_ encodes type information about a (possibly generic) class or interface declaration. It describes any type parameters of the class or interface, and lists its (possibly parameterized) direct superclass and direct superinterfaces, if any. A type parameter is described by its name, followed by any class bound and interface bounds.

A _method signature_ encodes type information about a (possibly generic) method declaration. It describes any type parameters of the method; the (possibly parameterized) types of any formal parameters; the (possibly parameterized) return type, if any; and the types of any exceptions declared in the method's `throws` clause.

MethodSignature:

VoidDescriptor:

`V`

A method signature encoded by the `Signature` attribute may not correspond exactly to the method descriptor in the `method_info` structure ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")). In particular, there is no assurance that the number of formal parameter types in the method signature is the same as the number of parameter descriptors in the method descriptor. The numbers are the same for most methods, but certain constructors in the Java programming language have an implicitly declared parameter which a compiler represents with a parameter descriptor but may omit from the method signature. See the note in [§4.7.18](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.18 "4.7.18. The RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations Attribute") for a similar situation involving parameter annotations.

A _field signature_ encodes the (possibly parameterized) type of a field, formal parameter, local variable, or record component declaration.

### 4.7.10. The `SourceFile` Attribute

The `SourceFile` attribute is an optional fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")).

There may be at most one `SourceFile` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `SourceFile` attribute has the following format:

```
SourceFile\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 sourcefile\_index;
}

```

The items of the `SourceFile_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`SourceFile`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be two.

sourcefile\_index

The value of the `sourcefile_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a string.

The string referenced by the `sourcefile_index` item will be interpreted as indicating the name of the source file from which this `class` file was compiled. It will not be interpreted as indicating the name of a directory containing the file or an absolute path name for the file; such platform-specific additional information must be supplied by the run-time interpreter or development tool at the time the file name is actually used.

### 4.7.11. The `SourceDebugExtension` Attribute

The `SourceDebugExtension` attribute is an optional attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")).

There may be at most one `SourceDebugExtension` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `SourceDebugExtension` attribute has the following format:

```
SourceDebugExtension\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;

    u1 debug\_extension\[attribute\_length\];
}

```

The items of the `SourceDebugExtension_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`SourceDebugExtension`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

debug\_extension\[\]

The `debug_extension` array holds extended debugging information which has no semantic effect on the Java Virtual Machine. The information is represented using a modified UTF-8 string ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) with no terminating zero byte.

Note that the `debug_extension` array may denote a string longer than that which can be represented with an instance of class `String`.

### 4.7.12. The `LineNumberTable` Attribute

The `LineNumberTable` attribute is an optional variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). It may be used by debuggers to determine which part of the `code` array corresponds to a given line number in the original source file.

If multiple `LineNumberTable` attributes are present in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute, then they may appear in any order.

There may be more than one `LineNumberTable` attribute _per line of a source file_ in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute. That is, `LineNumberTable` attributes may together represent a given line of a source file, and need not be one-to-one with source lines.

The `LineNumberTable` attribute has the following format:

```
LineNumberTable\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 line\_number\_table\_length;

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`LineNumberTable`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

line\_number\_table\_length

The value of the `line_number_table_length` item indicates the number of entries in the `line_number_table` array.

line\_number\_table\[\]

Each entry in the `line_number_table` array indicates that the line number in the original source file changes at a given point in the `code` array. Each `line_number_table` entry must contain the following two items:

start\_pc

The value of the `start_pc` item must be a valid index into the `code` array of this `Code` attribute. The item indicates the index into the `code` array at which the code for a new line in the original source file begins.

line\_number

The value of the `line_number` item gives the corresponding line number in the original source file.

### 4.7.13. The `LocalVariableTable` Attribute

The `LocalVariableTable` attribute is an optional variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). It may be used by debuggers to determine the value of a given local variable during the execution of a method.

If multiple `LocalVariableTable` attributes are present in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute, then they may appear in any order.

There may be no more than one `LocalVariableTable` attribute _per local variable_ in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute.

The `LocalVariableTable` attribute has the following format:

```
LocalVariableTable\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 local\_variable\_table\_length;
    {   u2 start\_pc;
        u2 length;
        u2 name\_index;
        u2 descriptor\_index;
        u2 index;
    } local\_variable\_table\[local\_variable\_table\_length\];
}

```

The items of the `LocalVariableTable_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`LocalVariableTable`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

local\_variable\_table\_length

The value of the `local_variable_table_length` item indicates the number of entries in the `local_variable_table` array.

local\_variable\_table\[\]

Each entry in the `local_variable_table` array indicates a range of `code` array offsets within which a local variable has a value, and indicates the index into the local variable array of the current frame at which that local variable can be found. Each entry must contain the following five items:

start\_pc, length

The value of the `start_pc` item must be a valid index into the `code` array of this `Code` attribute and must be the index of the opcode of an instruction.

The value of `start_pc + length` must either be a valid index into the `code` array of this `Code` attribute and be the index of the opcode of an instruction, or it must be the first index beyond the end of that `code` array.

The `start_pc` and `length` items indicate that the given local variable has a value at indices into the `code` array in the interval \[`start_pc`, `start_pc + length`), that is, between `start_pc` inclusive and `start_pc + length` exclusive.

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must contain a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a valid unqualified name denoting a local variable ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")).

descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must contain a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a field descriptor which encodes the type of a local variable in the source program ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")).

index

The value of the `index` item must be a valid index into the local variable array of the current frame. The given local variable is at `index` in the local variable array of the current frame.

If the given local variable is of type `double` or `long`, it occupies both `index` and `index + 1`.

### 4.7.14. The `LocalVariableTypeTable` Attribute

The `LocalVariableTypeTable` attribute is an optional variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). It may be used by debuggers to determine the value of a given local variable during the execution of a method.

If multiple `LocalVariableTypeTable` attributes are present in the `attributes` table of a given `Code` attribute, then they may appear in any order.

There may be no more than one `LocalVariableTypeTable` attribute _per local variable_ in the `attributes` table of a `Code` attribute.

The `LocalVariableTypeTable` attribute differs from the `LocalVariableTable` attribute ([§4.7.13](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.13 "4.7.13. The LocalVariableTable Attribute")) in that it provides signature information rather than descriptor information. This difference is only significant for variables whose type uses a type variable or parameterized type. Such variables will appear in both tables, while variables of other types will appear only in `LocalVariableTable`.

The `LocalVariableTypeTable` attribute has the following format:

```
LocalVariableTypeTable\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 local\_variable\_type\_table\_length;
    {   u2 start\_pc;
        u2 length;
        u2 name\_index;
        u2 signature\_index;
        u2 index;
    } local\_variable\_type\_table\[local\_variable\_type\_table\_length\];
}

```

The items of the `LocalVariableTypeTable_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`LocalVariableTypeTable`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

local\_variable\_type\_table\_length

The value of the `local_variable_type_table_length` item indicates the number of entries in the `local_variable_type_table` array.

local\_variable\_type\_table\[\]

Each entry in the `local_variable_type_table` array indicates a range of `code` array offsets within which a local variable has a value, and indicates the index into the local variable array of the current frame at which that local variable can be found. Each entry must contain the following five items:

start\_pc, length

The value of the `start_pc` item must be a valid index into the `code` array of this `Code` attribute and must be the index of the opcode of an instruction.

The value of `start_pc + length` must either be a valid index into the `code` array of this `Code` attribute and be the index of the opcode of an instruction, or it must be the first index beyond the end of that `code` array.

The `start_pc` and `length` items indicate that the given local variable has a value at indices into the `code` array in the interval \[`start_pc`, `start_pc + length`), that is, between `start_pc` inclusive and `start_pc + length` exclusive.

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must contain a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a valid unqualified name denoting a local variable ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")).

signature\_index

The value of the `signature_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must contain a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a field signature which encodes the type of a local variable in the source program ([§4.7.9.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.9.1 "4.7.9.1. Signatures")).

index

The value of the `index` item must be a valid index into the local variable array of the current frame. The given local variable is at `index` in the local variable array of the current frame.

If the given local variable is of type `double` or `long`, it occupies both `index` and `index + 1`.

### 4.7.15. The `Deprecated` Attribute

The `Deprecated` attribute is an optional fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, or `method_info` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")). A class, interface, method, or field may be marked using a `Deprecated` attribute to indicate that the class, interface, method, or field has been superseded.

A run-time interpreter or tool that reads the `class` file format, such as a compiler, can use this marking to advise the user that a superseded class, interface, method, or field is being referred to. The presence of a `Deprecated` attribute does not alter the semantics of a class or interface.

The `Deprecated` attribute has the following format:

```
Deprecated\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
}

```

The items of the `Deprecated_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`Deprecated`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be zero.

### 4.7.16. The `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` Attribute

The `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods"), [§4.7.30](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.30 "4.7.30. The Record Attribute")). The `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` attribute stores run-time visible annotations on the declaration of the corresponding class, field, method, or record component.

There may be at most one `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure.

The `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` attribute has the following format:

```
RuntimeVisibleAnnotations\_attribute {
    u2         attribute\_name\_index;
    u4         attribute\_length;
    u2         num\_annotations;
    annotation annotations\[num\_annotations\];
}

```

The items of the `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`RuntimeVisibleAnnotations`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

num\_annotations

The value of the `num_annotations` item gives the number of run-time visible annotations represented by the structure.

annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `annotations` table represents a single run-time visible annotation on a declaration. The `annotation` structure has the following format:

```
annotation {
    u2 type\_index;
    u2 num\_element\_value\_pairs;
    {   u2            element\_name\_index;
        element\_value value;
    } element\_value\_pairs\[num\_element\_value\_pairs\];
}
      
```

The items of the `annotation` structure are as follows:

type\_index

The value of the `type_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a field descriptor ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")). The field descriptor denotes the type of the annotation represented by this `annotation` structure.

num\_element\_value\_pairs

The value of the `num_element_value_pairs` item gives the number of element-value pairs of the annotation represented by this `annotation` structure.

element\_value\_pairs\[\]

Each value of the `element_value_pairs` table represents a single element-value pair in the annotation represented by this `annotation` structure. Each `element_value_pairs` entry contains the following two items:

element\_name\_index

The value of the `element_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")). The `constant_pool` entry denotes the name of the element of the element-value pair represented by this `element_value_pairs` entry.

In other words, the entry denotes an element of the annotation interface specified by `type_index`.

value

The value of the `value` item represents the value of the element-value pair represented by this `element_value_pairs` entry.

#### 4.7.16.1. The `element_value` structure

The `element_value` structure is a discriminated union representing the value of an element-value pair. It has the following format:

```
element\_value {
    u1 tag;
    union {
        u2 const\_value\_index;

        {   u2 type\_name\_index;
            u2 const\_name\_index;
        } enum\_const\_value;

        u2 class\_info\_index;

        annotation annotation\_value;

        {   u2            num\_values;
            element\_value values\[num\_values\];
        } array\_value;
    } value;
}

```

The `tag` item uses a single ASCII character to indicate the type of the value of the element-value pair. This determines which item of the `value` union is in use. [Table 4.7.16.1-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16.1-130 "Table 4.7.16.1-A. Interpretation of tag values as types") shows the valid characters for the `tag` item, the type indicated by each character, and the item used in the `value` union for each character. The table's fourth column is used in the description below of one item of the `value` union.

**Table 4.7.16.1-A. Interpretation of `tag` values as types**

   
| `tag` Item | Type | `value` Item | Constant Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `B` | `byte` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Integer` |
| `C` | `char` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Integer` |
| `D` | `double` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Double` |
| `F` | `float` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Float` |
| `I` | `int` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Integer` |
| `J` | `long` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Long` |
| `S` | `short` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Integer` |
| `Z` | `boolean` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Integer` |
| `s` | `String` | `const_value_index` | `CONSTANT_Utf8` |
| `e` | Enum class | `enum_const_value` | _Not applicable_ |
| `c` | `Class` | `class_info_index` | _Not applicable_ |
| `@` | Annotation interface | `annotation_value` | _Not applicable_ |
| `[` | Array type | `array_value` | _Not applicable_ |

  

The _value_ item represents the value of an element-value pair. The item is a union, whose own items are as follows:

const\_value\_index

The `const_value_index` item denotes a constant of either a primitive type or the type `String` as the value of this element-value pair.

The value of the `const_value_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be of a type appropriate to the `tag` item, as specified in the fourth column of [Table 4.7.16.1-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16.1-130 "Table 4.7.16.1-A. Interpretation of tag values as types").

enum\_const\_value

The `enum_const_value` item denotes an enum constant as the value of this element-value pair.

The `enum_const_value` item consists of the following two items:

type\_name\_index

The value of the `type_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a field descriptor ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")). The `constant_pool` entry gives the internal form of the binary name of the type of the enum constant represented by this `element_value` structure ([§4.2.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.1 "4.2.1. Binary Class and Interface Names")).

const\_name\_index

The value of the `const_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")). The `constant_pool` entry gives the simple name of the enum constant represented by this `element_value` structure.

class\_info\_index

The `class_info_index` item denotes a class literal as the value of this element-value pair.

The `class_info_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a return descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")). The return descriptor gives the type corresponding to the class literal represented by this `element_value` structure. Types correspond to class literals as follows:

*   For a class literal C`.``class`, where C is the name of a class, interface, or array type, the corresponding type is C. The return descriptor in the `constant_pool` will be an _ObjectType_ or an _ArrayType_.
    
*   For a class literal p`.``class`, where p is the name of a primitive type, the corresponding type is p. The return descriptor in the `constant_pool` will be a _BaseType_ character.
    
*   For a class literal `void``.``class`, the corresponding type is `void`. The return descriptor in the `constant_pool` will be _V_.
    

For example, the class literal `Object.class` corresponds to the type `Object`, so the `constant_pool` entry is `Ljava/lang/Object;`, whereas the class literal `int.class` corresponds to the type `int`, so the `constant_pool` entry is `I`.

The class literal `void.class` corresponds to `void`, so the `constant_pool` entry is _V_, whereas the class literal `Void.class` corresponds to the type `Void`, so the `constant_pool` entry is `Ljava/lang/Void;`.

annotation\_value

The `annotation_value` item denotes a "nested" annotation as the value of this element-value pair.

The value of the `annotation_value` item is an `annotation` structure ([§4.7.16](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16 "4.7.16. The RuntimeVisibleAnnotations Attribute")) that gives the annotation represented by this `element_value` structure.

array\_value

The `array_value` item denotes an array as the value of this element-value pair.

The `array_value` item consists of the following two items:

num\_values

The value of the `num_values` item gives the number of elements in the array represented by this `element_value` structure.

values\[\]

Each value in the `values` table gives the corresponding element of the array represented by this `element_value` structure.

### 4.7.17. The `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations` Attribute

The `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods"), [§4.7.30](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.30 "4.7.30. The Record Attribute")). The `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations` attribute stores run-time invisible annotations on the declaration of the corresponding class, method, field, or record component.

There may be at most one `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure.

The `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations` attribute is similar to the `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` attribute ([§4.7.16](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16 "4.7.16. The RuntimeVisibleAnnotations Attribute")), except that the annotations represented by a `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations` attribute must not be made available for return by reflective APIs, unless the Java Virtual Machine has been instructed to retain these annotations via some implementation-specific mechanism such as a command line flag. In the absence of such instructions, the Java Virtual Machine ignores this attribute.

The `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations` attribute has the following format:

```
RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations\_attribute {
    u2         attribute\_name\_index;
    u4         attribute\_length;
    u2         num\_annotations;
    annotation annotations\[num\_annotations\];
}

```

The items of the `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

num\_annotations

The value of the `num_annotations` item gives the number of run-time invisible annotations represented by the structure.

annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `annotations` table represents a single run-time invisible annotation on a declaration. The `annotation` structure is specified in [§4.7.16](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16 "4.7.16. The RuntimeVisibleAnnotations Attribute").

### 4.7.18. The `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` Attribute

The `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of the `method_info` structure ([§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")). The `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute stores run-time visible annotations on the declarations of formal parameters of the corresponding method.

There may be at most one `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure.

The `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute has the following format:

```
RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u1 num\_parameters;
    {   u2         num\_annotations;
        annotation annotations\[num\_annotations\];
    } parameter\_annotations\[num\_parameters\];
}

```

The items of the `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

num\_parameters

The value of the `num_parameters` item gives the number of run-time visible parameter annotations represented by this structure.

There is no assurance that this number is the same as the number of parameter descriptors in the method descriptor.

parameter\_annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `parameter_annotations` table represents all of the run-time visible annotations on the declaration of a single formal parameter. Each `parameter_annotations` entry contains the following two items:

num\_annotations

The value of the `num_annotations` item indicates the number of run-time visible annotations on the declaration of the formal parameter corresponding to the `parameter_annotations` entry.

annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `annotations` table represents a single run-time visible annotation on the declaration of the formal parameter corresponding to the `parameter_annotations` entry. The `annotation` structure is specified in [§4.7.16](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16 "4.7.16. The RuntimeVisibleAnnotations Attribute").

The _i_'th entry in the `parameter_annotations` table may, but is not required to, correspond to the _i_'th parameter descriptor in the method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).

For example, a compiler may choose to create entries in the table corresponding only to those parameter descriptors which represent explicitly declared parameters in source code. In the Java programming language, a constructor of an inner class is specified to have an implicitly declared parameter before its explicitly declared parameters (JLS §8.8.1), so the corresponding `<init>` method in a `class` file has a parameter descriptor representing the implicitly declared parameter before any parameter descriptors representing explicitly declared parameters. If the first explicitly declared parameter is annotated in source code, then a compiler may create `parameter_annotations[0]` to store annotations corresponding to the _second_ parameter descriptor.

### 4.7.19. The `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations` Attribute

The `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure ([§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")). The `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute stores run-time invisible annotations on the declarations of formal parameters of the corresponding method.

There may be at most one `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure.

The `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute is similar to the `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute ([§4.7.18](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.18 "4.7.18. The RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations Attribute")), except that the annotations represented by a `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute must not be made available for return by reflective APIs, unless the Java Virtual Machine has specifically been instructed to retain these annotations via some implementation-specific mechanism such as a command line flag. In the absence of such instructions, the Java Virtual Machine ignores this attribute.

The `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations` attribute has the following format:

```
RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u1 num\_parameters;
    {   u2         num\_annotations;
        annotation annotations\[num\_annotations\];
    } parameter\_annotations\[num\_parameters\];
}

```

The items of the `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

num\_parameters

The value of the `num_parameters` item gives the number of run-time invisible parameter annotations represented by this structure.

There is no assurance that this number is the same as the number of parameter descriptors in the method descriptor.

parameter\_annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `parameter_annotations` table represents all of the run-time invisible annotations on the declaration of a single formal parameter. Each `parameter_annotations` entry contains the following two items:

num\_annotations

The value of the `num_annotations` item indicates the number of run-time invisible annotations on the declaration of the formal parameter corresponding to the `parameter_annotations` entry.

annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `annotations` table represents a single run-time invisible annotation on the declaration of the formal parameter corresponding to the `parameter_annotations` entry. The `annotation` structure is specified in [§4.7.16](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16 "4.7.16. The RuntimeVisibleAnnotations Attribute").

The _i_'th entry in the `parameter_annotations` table may, but is not required to, correspond to the _i_'th parameter descriptor in the method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).

See the note in [§4.7.18](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.18 "4.7.18. The RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations Attribute") for an example of when `parameter_annotations[0]` does not correspond to the first parameter descriptor in the method descriptor.

### 4.7.20. The `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` Attribute

The `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute is an variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure, or `Code` attribute ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods"), [§4.7.30](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.30 "4.7.30. The Record Attribute"), [§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). The `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute stores run-time visible annotations on types used in the declaration of the corresponding class, field, method, or record component, or in an expression in the corresponding method body. The `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute also stores run-time visible annotations on type parameter declarations of generic classes, interfaces, methods, and constructors.

There may be at most one `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure, or `Code` attribute.

An `attributes` table contains a `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute only if types are annotated in kinds of declaration or expression that correspond to the parent structure or attribute of the `attributes` table.

For example, all annotations on types in the `implements` clause of a class declaration are recorded in the `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute of the class's `ClassFile` structure. Meanwhile, all annotations on the type in a field declaration are recorded in the `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute of the field's `field_info` structure.

The `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute has the following format:

```
RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations\_attribute {
    u2              attribute\_name\_index;
    u4              attribute\_length;
    u2              num\_annotations;
    type\_annotation annotations\[num\_annotations\];
}

```

The items of the `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing the string "`RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

num\_annotations

The value of the `num_annotations` item gives the number of run-time visible type annotations represented by the structure.

annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `annotations` table represents a single run-time visible annotation on a type used in a declaration or expression. The `type_annotation` structure has the following format:

```
type\_annotation {
    u1 target\_type;
    union {
        type\_parameter\_target;
        supertype\_target;
        type\_parameter\_bound\_target;
        empty\_target;
        formal\_parameter\_target;
        throws\_target;
        localvar\_target;
        catch\_target;
        offset\_target;
        type\_argument\_target;
    } target\_info;
    type\_path target\_path;
    u2        type\_index;
    u2        num\_element\_value\_pairs;
    {   u2            element\_name\_index;
        element\_value value;
    } element\_value\_pairs\[num\_element\_value\_pairs\];
}
      
```

The first three items - `target_type`, `target_info`, and `target_path` - specify the precise location of the annotated type. The last three items - `type_index`, `num_element_value_pairs`, and `element_value_pairs[]` - specify the annotation's own type and element-value pairs.

The items of the `type_annotation` structure are as follows:

target\_type

The value of the `target_type` item denotes the kind of target on which the annotation appears. The various kinds of target correspond to the _type contexts_ of the Java programming language where types are used in declarations and expressions (JLS §4.11).

The legal values of `target_type` are specified in [Table 4.7.20-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20-400 "Table 4.7.20-A. Interpretation of target_type values (Part 1)") and [Table 4.7.20-B](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20-410 "Table 4.7.20-B. Interpretation of target_type values (Part 2)"). Each value is a one-byte tag indicating which item of the `target_info` union follows the `target_type` item to give more information about the target.

The kinds of target in [Table 4.7.20-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20-400 "Table 4.7.20-A. Interpretation of target_type values (Part 1)") and [Table 4.7.20-B](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20-410 "Table 4.7.20-B. Interpretation of target_type values (Part 2)") correspond to the type contexts in JLS §4.11. Namely, `target_type` values 0x10-0x17 and 0x40-0x42 correspond to type contexts 1-11, while `target_type` values 0x43-0x4B correspond to type contexts 12-17.

The value of the `target_type` item determines whether the `type_annotation` structure appears in a `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute in a `ClassFile` structure, a `field_info` structure, a `method_info` structure, or a `Code` attribute. [Table 4.7.20-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20-420 "Table 4.7.20-C. Location of enclosing attribute for target_type values") gives the location of the `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute for a `type_annotation` structure with each legal `target_type` value.

target\_info

The value of the `target_info` item denotes precisely which type in a declaration or expression is annotated.

The items of the `target_info` union are specified in [§4.7.20.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20.1 "4.7.20.1. The target_info union").

target\_path

The value of the `target_path` item denotes precisely which part of the type indicated by `target_info` is annotated.

The format of the `type_path` structure is specified in [§4.7.20.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20.2 "4.7.20.2. The type_path structure").

type\_index, num\_element\_value\_pairs, element\_value\_pairs\[\]

The meaning of these items in the `type_annotation` structure is the same as their meaning in the `annotation` structure ([§4.7.16](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.16 "4.7.16. The RuntimeVisibleAnnotations Attribute")).

#### 4.7.20.1. The `target_info` union

The items of the `target_info` union (except for the first) specify precisely which type in a declaration or expression is annotated. The first item specifies not which type, but rather which declaration of a type parameter is annotated. The items are as follows:

*   The `type_parameter_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on the declaration of the _i_'th type parameter of a generic class, generic interface, generic method, or generic constructor.
    
    ```
    type\_parameter\_target {
        u1 type\_parameter\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the `type_parameter_index` item specifies which type parameter declaration is annotated. A `type_parameter_index` value of `0` specifies the first type parameter declaration.
    
*   The `supertype_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on a type in the `extends` or `implements` clause of a class or interface declaration.
    
    ```
    supertype\_target {
        u2 supertype\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
    A `supertype_index` value of 65535 specifies that the annotation appears on the superclass in an `extends` clause of a class declaration.
    
    Any other `supertype_index` value is an index into the `interfaces` array of the enclosing `ClassFile` structure, and specifies that the annotation appears on that superinterface in either the `implements` clause of a class declaration or the `extends` clause of an interface declaration.
    
*   The `type_parameter_bound_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on the _i_'th bound of the _j_'th type parameter declaration of a generic class, interface, method, or constructor.
    
    ```
    type\_parameter\_bound\_target {
        u1 type\_parameter\_index;
        u1 bound\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the of `type_parameter_index` item specifies which type parameter declaration has an annotated bound. A `type_parameter_index` value of `0` specifies the first type parameter declaration.
    
    The value of the `bound_index` item specifies which bound of the type parameter declaration indicated by `type_parameter_index` is annotated. A `bound_index` value of `0` specifies the first bound of a type parameter declaration.
    
    The `type_parameter_bound_target` item records that a bound is annotated, but does not record the type which constitutes the bound. The type may be found by inspecting the class signature or method signature stored in the appropriate `Signature` attribute.
    
*   The `empty_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on either the type in a field declaration, the type in a record component declaration, the return type of a method, the type of a newly constructed object, or the receiver type of a method or constructor.
    
    ```
    empty\_target {
    }
        
    ```
    
    Only one type appears in each of these locations, so there is no per-type information to represent in the `target_info` union.
    
*   The `formal_parameter_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on the type in a formal parameter declaration of a method, constructor, or lambda expression.
    
    ```
    formal\_parameter\_target {
        u1 formal\_parameter\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the `formal_parameter_index` item specifies which formal parameter declaration has an annotated type. A `formal_parameter_index` value of _i_ may, but is not required to, correspond to the _i_'th parameter descriptor in the method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).
    
    The `formal_parameter_target` item records that a formal parameter's type is annotated, but does not record the type itself. The type may be found by inspecting the method descriptor, although a `formal_parameter_index` value of `0` does not always indicate the first parameter descriptor in the method descriptor; see the note in [§4.7.18](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.18 "4.7.18. The RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations Attribute") for a similar situation involving the `parameter_annotations` table.
    
*   The `throws_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on the _i_'th type in the `throws` clause of a method or constructor declaration.
    
    ```
    throws\_target {
        u2 throws\_type\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the `throws_type_index` item is an index into the `exception_index_table` array of the `Exceptions` attribute of the `method_info` structure enclosing the `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute.
    
*   The `localvar_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on the type in a local variable declaration, including a variable declared as a resource in a `try`\-with-resources statement.
    
    ```
    localvar\_target {
        u2 table\_length;
        {   u2 start\_pc;
            u2 length;
            u2 index;
        } table\[table\_length\];
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the `table_length` item gives the number of entries in the `table` array. Each entry indicates a range of `code` array offsets within which a local variable has a value. It also indicates the index into the local variable array of the current frame at which that local variable can be found. Each entry contains the following three items:
    
    start\_pc, length
    
    The given local variable has a value at indices into the `code` array in the interval \[`start_pc`, `start_pc + length`), that is, between `start_pc` inclusive and `start_pc + length` exclusive.
    
    index
    
    The given local variable must be at `index` in the local variable array of the current frame.
    
    If the local variable at `index` is of type `double` or `long`, it occupies both `index` and `index + 1`.
    
    A table is needed to fully specify the local variable whose type is annotated, because a single local variable may be represented with different local variable indices over multiple live ranges. The `start_pc`, `length`, and `index` items in each table entry specify the same information as a `LocalVariableTable` attribute.
    
    The `localvar_target` item records that a local variable's type is annotated, but does not record the type itself. The type may be found by inspecting the appropriate `LocalVariableTable` attribute.
    
*   The `catch_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on the _i_'th type in an exception parameter declaration.
    
    ```
    catch\_target {
        u2 exception\_table\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the `exception_table_index` item is an index into the `exception_table` array of the `Code` attribute enclosing the `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute.
    
    The possibility of more than one type in an exception parameter declaration arises from the multi-`catch` clause of the `try` statement, where the type of the exception parameter is a union of types (JLS §14.20). A compiler usually creates one `exception_table` entry for each type in the union, which allows the `catch_target` item to distinguish them. This preserves the correspondence between a type and its annotations.
    
*   The `offset_target` item indicates that an annotation appears on either the type in an _instanceof_ expression or a _new_ expression, or the type before the `::` in a method reference expression.
    
    ```
    offset\_target {
        u2 offset;
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the `offset` item specifies the `code` array offset of either the bytecode instruction corresponding to the _instanceof_ expression, the _new_ bytecode instruction corresponding to the _new_ expression, or the bytecode instruction corresponding to the method reference expression.
    
*   The `type_argument_target` item indicates that an annotation appears either on the _i_'th type in a cast expression, or on the _i_'th type argument in the explicit type argument list for any of the following: a _new_ expression, an explicit constructor invocation statement, a method invocation expression, or a method reference expression.
    
    ```
    type\_argument\_target {
        u2 offset;
        u1 type\_argument\_index;
    }
        
    ```
    
    The value of the `offset` item specifies the `code` array offset of either the bytecode instruction corresponding to the cast expression, the _new_ bytecode instruction corresponding to the _new_ expression, the bytecode instruction corresponding to the explicit constructor invocation statement, the bytecode instruction corresponding to the method invocation expression, or the bytecode instruction corresponding to the method reference expression.
    
    For a cast expression, the value of the `type_argument_index` item specifies which type in the cast operator is annotated. A `type_argument_index` value of `0` specifies the first (or only) type in the cast operator.
    
    The possibility of more than one type in a cast expression arises from a cast to an intersection type.
    
    For an explicit type argument list, the value of the `type_argument_index` item specifies which type argument is annotated. A `type_argument_index` value of `0` specifies the first type argument.
    

#### 4.7.20.2. The `type_path` structure

Wherever a type is used in a declaration or expression, the `type_path` structure identifies which part of the type is annotated. An annotation may appear on the type itself, but if the type is a reference type, then there are additional locations where an annotation may appear:

*   If an array type T`[]` is used in a declaration or expression, then an annotation may appear on any component type of the array type, including the element type.
    
*   If a nested type T1`.`T2 is used in a declaration or expression, then an annotation may appear on the name of the innermost member type and any enclosing type for which a type annotation is admissible (JLS §9.7.4).
    
*   If a parameterized type T`<`A`>` or T`<`? extends A`>` or T`<`? super A`>` is used in a declaration or expression, then an annotation may appear on any type argument or on the bound of any wildcard type argument.
    

For example, consider the different parts of `String``[]``[]` that are annotated in:

```
@Foo String\[\]\[\]   // Annotates the class type String
String @Foo \[\]\[\]  // Annotates the array type String\[\]\[\]
String\[\] @Foo \[\]  // Annotates the array type String\[\]

```

or the different parts of the nested type `Outer.Middle.Inner` that are annotated in:

```
@Foo Outer.Middle.Inner
Outer.@Foo Middle.Inner
Outer.Middle.@Foo Inner

```

or the different parts of the parameterized types `Map<String,Object>` and `List<...>` that are annotated in:

```
@Foo Map<String,Object>
Map<@Foo String,Object>
Map<String,@Foo Object>

List<@Foo ? extends String>
List<? extends @Foo String>

```

The `type_path` structure has the following format:

```
type\_path {
    u1 path\_length;
    {   u1 type\_path\_kind;
        u1 type\_argument\_index;
    } path\[path\_length\];
}

```

The value of the `path_length` item gives the number of entries in the `path` array:

*   If the value of `path_length` is `0`, and the type being annotated is a nested type, then the annotation applies to the outermost part of the type for which a type annotation is admissible.
    
*   If the value of `path_length` is `0`, and the type being annotated is not a nested type, then the annotation appears directly on the type itself.
    
*   If the value of `path_length` is non-zero, then each entry in the `path` array represents an iterative, left-to-right step towards the precise location of the annotation in an array type, nested type, or parameterized type. (In an array type, the iteration visits the array type itself, then its component type, then the component type of that component type, and so on, until the element type is reached.) Each entry contains the following two items:
    
    type\_path\_kind
    
    The legal values for the `type_path_kind` item are listed in [Table 4.7.20.2-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20.2-220-B-A.1 "Table 4.7.20.2-A. Interpretation of type_path_kind values").
    
    **Table 4.7.20.2-A. Interpretation of `type_path_kind` values**
    
     
    | Value | Interpretation |
    | --- | --- |
    | `0` | Annotation is deeper in an array type |
    | `1` | Annotation is deeper in a nested type |
    | `2` | Annotation is on the bound of a wildcard type argument of a parameterized type |
    | `3` | Annotation is on a type argument of a parameterized type |
    
      
    
    type\_argument\_index
    
    If the value of the `type_path_kind` item is `0`, `1`, or `2`, then the value of the `type_argument_index` item is `0`.
    
    If the value of the `type_path_kind` item is `3`, then the value of the `type_argument_index` item specifies which type argument of a parameterized type is annotated, where `0` indicates the first type argument of a parameterized type.

### 4.7.21. The `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations` Attribute

The `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute is an variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure, or `Code` attribute ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"), [§4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.5 "4.5. Fields"), [§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods"), [§4.7.30](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.30 "4.7.30. The Record Attribute"), [§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). The `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute stores run-time invisible annotations on types used in the corresponding declaration of a class, field, method, or record component, or in an expression in the corresponding method body. The `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute also stores annotations on type parameter declarations of generic classes, interfaces, methods, and constructors.

There may be at most one `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile`, `field_info`, `method_info`, or `record_component_info` structure, or `Code` attribute.

An `attributes` table contains a `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute only if types are annotated in kinds of declaration or expression that correspond to the parent structure or attribute of the `attributes` table.

The `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute has the following format:

```
RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations\_attribute {
    u2              attribute\_name\_index;
    u4              attribute\_length;
    u2              num\_annotations;
    type\_annotation annotations\[num\_annotations\];
}

```

The items of the `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing the string "`RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

num\_annotations

The value of the `num_annotations` item gives the number of run-time invisible type annotations represented by the structure.

annotations\[\]

Each entry in the `annotations` table represents a single run-time invisible annotation on a type used in a declaration or expression. The `type_annotation` structure is specified in [§4.7.20](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.20 "4.7.20. The RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations Attribute").

### 4.7.22. The `AnnotationDefault` Attribute

The `AnnotationDefault` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of certain `method_info` structures ([§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")), namely those representing elements of annotation interfaces (JLS §9.6.1). The `AnnotationDefault` attribute records the default value (JLS §9.6.2) for the element represented by the `method_info` structure.

There may be at most one `AnnotationDefault` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure which represents an element of an annotation interface.

The `AnnotationDefault` attribute has the following format:

```
AnnotationDefault\_attribute {
    u2            attribute\_name\_index;
    u4            attribute\_length;
    element\_value default\_value;
}

```

The items of the `AnnotationDefault_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`AnnotationDefault`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

default\_value

The `default_value` item represents the default value of the annotation interface element represented by the `method_info` structure enclosing this `AnnotationDefault` attribute.

### 4.7.23. The `BootstrapMethods` Attribute

The `BootstrapMethods` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). The `BootstrapMethods` attribute records bootstrap methods used to produce dynamically-computed constants and dynamically-computed call sites ([§4.4.10](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.10 "4.4.10. The CONSTANT_Dynamic_info and CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info Structures")).

There must be exactly one `BootstrapMethods` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure if the `constant_pool` table of the `ClassFile` structure has at least one `CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` or `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` entry.

There may be at most one `BootstrapMethods` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `BootstrapMethods` attribute has the following format:

```
BootstrapMethods\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 num\_bootstrap\_methods;
    {   u2 bootstrap\_method\_ref;
        u2 num\_bootstrap\_arguments;
        u2 bootstrap\_arguments\[num\_bootstrap\_arguments\];
    } bootstrap\_methods\[num\_bootstrap\_methods\];
}

```

The items of the `BootstrapMethods_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`BootstrapMethods`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

num\_bootstrap\_methods

The value of the `num_bootstrap_methods` item determines the number of bootstrap method specifiers in the `bootstrap_methods` array.

bootstrap\_methods\[\]

Each entry in the `bootstrap_methods` table contains an index to a `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure which specifies a bootstrap method, and a sequence (perhaps empty) of indexes to _static arguments_ for the bootstrap method.

Each `bootstrap_methods` entry must contain the following three items:

bootstrap\_method\_ref

The value of the `bootstrap_method_ref` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure ([§4.4.8](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.8 "4.4.8. The CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info Structure")).

The method handle will be resolved during resolution of a dynamically-computed constant or call site ([§5.4.3.6](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.3.6 "5.4.3.6. Dynamically-Computed Constant and Call Site Resolution")), and then invoked as if by invocation of `invokeWithArguments` in `java.lang.invoke.MethodHandle`. The method handle must be able to accept the array of arguments described in [§5.4.3.6](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.3.6 "5.4.3.6. Dynamically-Computed Constant and Call Site Resolution"), or resolution will fail.

num\_bootstrap\_arguments

The value of the `num_bootstrap_arguments` item gives the number of items in the `bootstrap_arguments` array.

bootstrap\_arguments\[\]

Each entry in the `bootstrap_arguments` array must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be loadable ([§4.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4 "4.4. The Constant Pool")).

### 4.7.24. The `MethodParameters` Attribute

The `MethodParameters` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure ([§4.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6 "4.6. Methods")). A `MethodParameters` attribute records information about the formal parameters of a method, such as their names.

There may be at most one `MethodParameters` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `method_info` structure.

The `MethodParameters` attribute has the following format:

```
MethodParameters\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u1 parameters\_count;
    {   u2 name\_index;
        u2 access\_flags;
    } parameters\[parameters\_count\];
}

```

The items of the `MethodParameters_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`MethodParameters`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

parameters\_count

The value of the `parameters_count` item indicates the number of parameter descriptors in the method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")) referenced by the `descriptor_index` of the attribute's enclosing `method_info` structure.

This is not a constraint which a Java Virtual Machine implementation must enforce during format checking ([§4.8](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.8 "4.8. Format Checking")). The task of matching parameter descriptors in a method descriptor against the items in the `parameters` array below is done by the reflection libraries of the Java SE Platform.

parameters\[\]

Each entry in the `parameters` array contains the following pair of items:

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must either be zero or a valid index into the `constant_pool` table.

If the value of the `name_index` item is zero, then this `parameters` element indicates a formal parameter with no name.

If the value of the `name_index` item is nonzero, the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing a valid unqualified name denoting a formal parameter ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")).

access\_flags

The value of the `access_flags` item is as follows:

0x0010 (`ACC_FINAL`)

Indicates that the formal parameter was declared `final`.

0x1000 (`ACC_SYNTHETIC`)

Indicates that the formal parameter was not explicitly or implicitly declared in source code, according to the specification of the language in which the source code was written (JLS §13.1). (The formal parameter is an implementation artifact of the compiler which produced this `class` file.)

0x8000 (`ACC_MANDATED`)

Indicates that the formal parameter was implicitly declared in source code, according to the specification of the language in which the source code was written (JLS §13.1). (The formal parameter is mandated by a language specification, so all compilers for the language must emit it.)

The _i_'th entry in the `parameters` array corresponds to the _i_'th parameter descriptor in the enclosing method's descriptor. (The `parameters_count` item is one byte because a method descriptor is limited to 255 parameters.) Effectively, this means the `parameters` array stores information for all the parameters of the method. One could imagine other schemes, where entries in the `parameters` array specify their corresponding parameter descriptors, but it would unduly complicate the `MethodParameters` attribute.

The _i_'th entry in the `parameters` array may or may not correspond to the _i_'th type in the enclosing method's `Signature` attribute (if present), or to the _i_'th annotation in the enclosing method's parameter annotations.

### 4.7.25. The `Module` Attribute

The `Module` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). The `Module` attribute indicates the modules required by a module; the packages exported and opened by a module; and the services used and provided by a module.

There may be at most one `Module` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `Module` attribute has the following format:

```
Module\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;

    u2 module\_name\_index;
    u2 module\_flags;
    u2 module\_version\_index;

    u2 requires\_count;
    {   u2 requires\_index;
        u2 requires\_flags;
        u2 requires\_version\_index;
    } requires\[requires\_count\];

    u2 exports\_count;
    {   u2 exports\_index;
        u2 exports\_flags;
        u2 exports\_to\_count;
        u2 exports\_to\_index\[exports\_to\_count\];
    } exports\[exports\_count\];

    u2 opens\_count;
    {   u2 opens\_index;
        u2 opens\_flags;
        u2 opens\_to\_count;
        u2 opens\_to\_index\[opens\_to\_count\];
    } opens\[opens\_count\];

    u2 uses\_count;
    u2 uses\_index\[uses\_count\];

    u2 provides\_count;
    {   u2 provides\_index;
        u2 provides\_with\_count;
        u2 provides\_with\_index\[provides\_with\_count\];
    } provides\[provides\_count\];
}

```

The items of the `Module_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`Module`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

module\_name\_index

The value of the `module_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure ([§4.4.11](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.11 "4.4.11. The CONSTANT_Module_info Structure")) denoting the current module.

module\_flags

The value of the `module_flags` item is as follows:

0x0020 (`ACC_OPEN`)

Indicates that this module is open.

0x1000 (`ACC_SYNTHETIC`)

Indicates that this module was not explicitly or implicitly declared.

0x8000 (`ACC_MANDATED`)

Indicates that this module was implicitly declared.

module\_version\_index

The value of the `module_version_index` item must be either zero or a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. If the value of the item is zero, then no version information about the current module is present. If the value of the item is nonzero, then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing the version of the current module.

requires\_count

The value of the `requires_count` item indicates the number of entries in the `requires` table.

If the current module is `java.base`, then `requires_count` must be zero.

If the current module is not `java.base`, then `requires_count` must be at least one.

requires\[\]

Each entry in the `requires` table specifies a dependence of the current module. The items in each entry are as follows:

requires\_index

The value of the `requires_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure denoting a module on which the current module depends.

At most one entry in the `requires` table may specify a module of a given name with its `requires_index` item.

requires\_flags

The value of the `requires_flags` item is as follows:

0x0020 (`ACC_TRANSITIVE`)

Indicates that any module which depends on the current module, implicitly declares a dependence on the module indicated by this entry.

0x0040 (`ACC_STATIC_PHASE`)

Indicates that this dependence is mandatory in the static phase, i.e., at compile time, but is optional in the dynamic phase, i.e., at run time.

0x1000 (`ACC_SYNTHETIC`)

Indicates that this dependence was not explicitly or implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.

0x8000 (`ACC_MANDATED`)

Indicates that this dependence was implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.

requires\_version\_index

The value of the `requires_version_index` item must be either zero or a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. If the value of the item is zero, then no version information about the dependence is present. If the value of the item is nonzero, then the `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure representing the version of the module specified by `requires_index`.

Unless the current module is `java.base`, exactly one entry in the `requires` table must have all of the following:

*   A `requires_index` item that indicates `java.base`.
    
*   A `requires_flags` item that has the `ACC_SYNTHETIC` flag not set. (The `ACC_MANDATED` flag may be set.)
    
*   If the `class` file version number is 54.0 or above, a `requires_flags` item that has both the `ACC_TRANSITIVE` and `ACC_STATIC_PHASE` flags not set.
    

exports\_count

The value of the `exports_count` item indicates the number of entries in the `exports` table.

exports\[\]

Each entry in the `exports` table specifies a package exported by the current module, such that `public` and `protected` types in the package, and their `public` and `protected` members, may be accessed from outside the current module, possibly from a limited set of "friend" modules.

The items in each entry are as follows:

The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure ([§4.4.12](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.12 "4.4.12. The CONSTANT_Package_info Structure")) representing a package exported by the current module.

At most one entry in the `exports` table may specify a package of a given name with its `exports_index` item.

exports\_flags

The value of the `exports_flags` item is as follows:

0x1000 (`ACC_SYNTHETIC`)

Indicates that this export was not explicitly or implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.

0x8000 (`ACC_MANDATED`)

Indicates that this export was implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.

exports\_to\_count

The value of the `exports_to_count` indicates the number of entries in the `exports_to_index` table.

If `exports_to_count` is zero, then this package is exported by the current module in an _unqualified_ fashion; code in any other module may access the types and members in the package.

If `exports_to_count` is nonzero, then this package is exported by the current module in a _qualified_ fashion; only code in the modules listed in the `exports_to_index` table may access the types and members in the package.

exports\_to\_index\[\]

The value of each entry in the `exports_to_index` table must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure denoting a module whose code can access the types and members in this exported package.

For each entry in the `exports` table, at most one entry in its `exports_to_index` table may specify a module of a given name.

opens\_count

The value of the `opens_count` item indicates the number of entries in the `opens` table.

`opens_count` must be zero if the current module is open.

opens\[\]

Each entry in the `opens` table specifies a package opened by the current module, such that all types in the package, and all their members, may be accessed from outside the current module via the reflection libraries of the Java SE Platform, possibly from a limited set of "friend" modules.

The items in each entry are as follows:

opens\_index

The value of the `opens_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure representing a package opened by the current module.

At most one entry in the `opens` table may specify a package of a given name with its `opens_index` item.

opens\_flags

The value of the `opens_flags` item is as follows:

0x1000 (`ACC_SYNTHETIC`)

Indicates that this opening was not explicitly or implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.

0x8000 (`ACC_MANDATED`)

Indicates that this opening was implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.

opens\_to\_count

The value of the `opens_to_count` indicates the number of entries in the `opens_to_index` table.

If `opens_to_count` is zero, then this package is opened by the current module in an _unqualified_ fashion; code in any other module may reflectively access the types and members in the package.

If `opens_to_count` is nonzero, then this package is opened by the current module in a _qualified_ fashion; only code in the modules listed in the `opens_to_index` table may reflectively access the types and members in the package.

opens\_to\_index\[\]

The value of each entry in the `opens_to_index` table must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Module_info` structure denoting a module whose code can access the types and members in this opened package.

For each entry in the `opens` table, at most one entry in its `opens_to_index` table may specify a module of a given name.

The value of the `uses_count` item indicates the number of entries in the `uses_index` table.

uses\_index\[\]

The value of each entry in the `uses_index` table must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing a service interface which the current module may discover via `java.util.ServiceLoader`.

At most one entry in the `uses_index` table may specify a service interface of a given name.

provides\_count

The value of the `provides_count` item indicates the number of entries in the `provides` table.

provides\[\]

Each entry in the `provides` table represents a service implementation for a given service interface.

The items in each entry are as follows:

provides\_index

The value of the `provides_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing a service interface for which the current module provides a service implementation.

At most one entry in the `provides` table may specify a service interface of a given name with its `provides_index` item.

provides\_with\_count

The value of the `provides_with_count` indicates the number of entries in the `provides_with_index` table.

`provides_with_count` must be nonzero.

provides\_with\_index\[\]

The value of each entry in the `provides_with_index` table must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure representing a service implementation for the service interface specified by `provides_index`.

For each entry in the `provides` table, at most one entry in its `provides_with_index` table may specify a service implementation of a given name.

### 4.7.26. The `ModulePackages` Attribute

The `ModulePackages` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). The `ModulePackages` attribute indicates all the packages of a module that are exported or opened by the `Module` attribute, as well as all the packages of the service implementations recorded in the `Module` attribute. The `ModulePackages` attribute may also indicate packages in the module that are neither exported nor opened nor contain service implementations.

There may be at most one `ModulePackages` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `ModulePackages` attribute has the following format:

```
ModulePackages\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 package\_count;
    u2 package\_index\[package\_count\];
}

```

The items of the `ModulePackages_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`ModulePackages`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

package\_count

The value of the `package_count` item indicates the number of entries in the `package_index` table.

package\_index\[\]

The value of each entry in the `package_index` table must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Package_info` structure ([§4.4.12](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.12 "4.4.12. The CONSTANT_Package_info Structure")) representing a package in the current module.

At most one entry in the `package_index` table may specify a package of a given name.

### 4.7.27. The `ModuleMainClass` Attribute

The `ModuleMainClass` attribute is a fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure"). The `ModuleMainClass` attribute indicates the main class of a module.

There may be at most one `ModuleMainClass` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `ModuleMainClass` attribute has the following format:

```
ModuleMainClass\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 main\_class\_index;
}

```

The items of the `ModuleMainClass_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`ModuleMainClass`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be two.

main\_class\_index

The value of the `main_class_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing the main class of the current module.

### 4.7.28. The `NestHost` Attribute

The `NestHost` attribute is a fixed-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure. The `NestHost` attribute records the nest host of the nest to which the current class or interface claims to belong ([§5.4.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4 "5.4.4. Access Control")).

There may be at most one `NestHost` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `NestHost` attribute has the following format:

```
NestHost\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 host\_class\_index;
}

```

The items of the `NestHost_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`NestHost`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item must be two.

host\_class\_index

The value of the `host_class_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing a class or interface which is the nest host for the current class or interface.

If the nest host cannot be loaded, or is not in the same run-time package as the current class or interface, or does not authorize nest membership for the current class or interface, then an error may occur during access control ([§5.4.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4 "5.4.4. Access Control")).

### 4.7.29. The `NestMembers` Attribute

The `NestMembers` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). The `NestMembers` attribute records the classes and interfaces that are authorized to claim membership in the nest hosted by the current class or interface ([§5.4.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4 "5.4.4. Access Control")).

There may be at most one `NestMembers` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure must not contain both a `NestMembers` attribute and a `NestHost` attribute.

This rule prevents a nest host from claiming membership in a different nest. It is implicitly a member of the nest that it hosts.

The `NestMembers` attribute has the following format:

```
NestMembers\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 number\_of\_classes;
    u2 classes\[number\_of\_classes\];
}

```

The items of the `NestMembers_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`NestMembers`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

number\_of\_classes

The value of the `number_of_classes` item indicates the number of entries in the `classes` array.

classes\[\]

Each value in the `classes` array must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing a class or interface which is a member of the nest hosted by the current class or interface.

The `classes` array is consulted by access control ([§5.4.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4 "5.4.4. Access Control")). It should consist of references to other classes and interfaces that are in the same run-time package and have `NestHost` attributes which reference the current class or interface. Array items that do not meet these criteria are ignored by access control.

### 4.7.30. The `Record` Attribute

The `Record` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). The `Record` attribute indicates that the current class is a record class (JLS §8.10), and stores information about the record components of the record class (JLS §8.10.1).

There may be at most one `Record` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure.

The `Record` attribute has the following format:

```
Record\_attribute {
    u2                    attribute\_name\_index;
    u4                    attribute\_length;
    u2                    components\_count;
    record\_component\_info components\[components\_count\];
}

```

The items of the `Record_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`Record`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

components\_count

The value of the `components_count` item indicates the number of entries in the `components` table.

components\[\]

Each entry in the `components` table specifies a record component of the current class, in the order the record components were declared. The `record_component_info` structure has the following format:

```
record\_component\_info {
    u2             name\_index;
    u2             descriptor\_index;
    u2             attributes\_count;
    attribute\_info attributes\[attributes\_count\];
}
      
```

The items of the `record_component_info` structure are as follows:

name\_index

The value of the `name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a valid unqualified name denoting the record component ([§4.2.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.2.2 "4.2.2. Unqualified Names")).

descriptor\_index

The value of the `descriptor_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing a field descriptor which encodes the type of the record component ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")).

attributes\_count

The value of the `attributes_count` item indicates the number of additional attributes of this record component.

attributes\[\]

Each value of the `attributes` table must be an `attribute_info` structure ([§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes")).

A record component can have any number of optional attributes associated with it.

The attributes defined by this specification as appearing in the `attributes` table of a `record_component_info` structure are listed in [Table 4.7-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7-320 "Table 4.7-C. Predefined class file attributes (by location)").

The rules concerning attributes defined to appear in the `attributes` table of a `record_component_info` structure are given in [§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes").

The rules concerning non-predefined attributes in the `attributes` table of a `record_component_info` structure are given in [§4.7.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.1 "4.7.1. Defining and Naming New Attributes").

### 4.7.31. The `PermittedSubclasses` Attribute

The `PermittedSubclasses` attribute is a variable-length attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). The `PermittedSubclasses` attribute records the classes and interfaces that are authorized to directly extend or implement the current class or interface ([§5.3.5](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3.5 "5.3.5. Deriving a Class from a class File Representation")).

The Java programming language uses the modifier `sealed` to indicate a class or interface that limits its direct subclasses or direct subinterfaces. One might suppose that this modifier would correspond to an `ACC_SEALED` flag in a `class` file, since the related modifier `final` corresponds to the `ACC_FINAL` flag. In fact, a `sealed` class or interface is indicated in a `class` file by the presence of the `PermittedSubclasses` attribute.

There may be at most one `PermittedSubclasses` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure whose `access_flags` item does not have the `ACC_FINAL` flag set.

There must be no `PermittedSubclasses` attribute in the `attributes` table of a `ClassFile` structure whose `access_flags` item has the `ACC_FINAL` flag set.

`sealed` is distinct from `final`: a `sealed` class has a list of authorized subclasses, which a `final` class has no subclasses. Thus, a `ClassFile` structure may have a `PermittedSubclasses` attribute, or have its `ACC_FINAL` flag set, but not both.

The `PermittedSubclasses` attribute has the following format:

```
PermittedSubclasses\_attribute {
    u2 attribute\_name\_index;
    u4 attribute\_length;
    u2 number\_of\_classes;
    u2 classes\[number\_of\_classes\];
}

```

The items of the `PermittedSubclasses_attribute` structure are as follows:

attribute\_name\_index

The value of the `attribute_name_index` item must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")) representing the string "`PermittedSubclasses`".

attribute\_length

The value of the `attribute_length` item indicates the length of the attribute, excluding the initial six bytes.

number\_of\_classes

The value of the `number_of_classes` item indicates the number of entries in the `classes` array.

classes\[\]

Each value in the `classes` array must be a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The `constant_pool` entry at that index must be a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")) representing a class or interface which is authorized to directly extend or implement the current class or interface.

The `classes` array is consulted when a class or interface is created that attempts to directly extend or implement the current class or interface ([§5.3.5](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3.5 "5.3.5. Deriving a Class from a class File Representation")). Array items that represent classes or interfaces which do not attempt to directly extend or implement the current class or interface are ignored.

4.8. Format Checking
--------------------

When a prospective `class` file is loaded by the Java Virtual Machine ([§5.3](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3 "5.3. Creation and Loading")), the Java Virtual Machine first ensures that the file has the basic format of a `class` file ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). This process is known as _format checking_. The checks are as follows:

*   The first four bytes must contain the right magic number.
    
*   All predefined attributes ([§4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7 "4.7. Attributes")) must be of the proper length, except for `StackMapTable`, `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations`, `RuntimeInvisibleAnnotations`, `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations`, `RuntimeInvisibleParameterAnnotations`, `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations`, `RuntimeInvisibleTypeAnnotations`, and `AnnotationDefault`.
    
*   The `class` file must not be truncated or have extra bytes at the end.
    
*   The constant pool must satisfy the constraints documented throughout [§4.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4 "4.4. The Constant Pool").
    
    For example, each `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure in the constant pool must contain in its `name_index` item a valid constant pool index for a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure.
    
*   All field references and method references in the constant pool must have valid names, valid classes, and valid descriptors ([§4.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3 "4.3. Descriptors")).
    
    Format checking does not ensure that the given field or method actually exists in the given class, nor that the descriptors given refer to real classes. Format checking ensures only that these items are well formed. More detailed checking is performed when the bytecodes themselves are verified, and during resolution.
    

These checks for basic `class` file integrity are necessary for any interpretation of the `class` file contents. Format checking is distinct from bytecode verification, although historically they have been confused because both are a form of integrity check.

4.9. Constraints on Java Virtual Machine Code
---------------------------------------------

The code for a method, instance initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")), or class or interface initialization method ([§2.9.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.2 "2.9.2. Class Initialization Methods")) is stored in the `code` array of the `Code` attribute of a `method_info` structure of a `class` file ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). This section describes the constraints associated with the contents of the `Code_attribute` structure.

### 4.9.1. Static Constraints

The _static constraints_ on a `class` file are those defining the well-formedness of the file. These constraints have been given in the previous sections, except for static constraints on the code in the `class` file. The static constraints on the code in a `class` file specify how Java Virtual Machine instructions must be laid out in the `code` array and what the operands of individual instructions must be.

The static constraints on the instructions in the `code` array are as follows:

*   Only instances of the instructions documented in [§6.5](jvms-6.html#jvms-6.5 "6.5. Instructions") may appear in the `code` array. Instances of instructions using the reserved opcodes ([§6.2](jvms-6.html#jvms-6.2 "6.2. Reserved Opcodes")) or any opcodes not documented in this specification must not appear in the `code` array.
    
    If the `class` file version number is 51.0 or above, then instances of instructions using the _jsr_, _jsr\_w_, or _ret_ opcodes must not appear in the `code` array.
    
*   The opcode of the first instruction in the `code` array begins at index `0`.
    
*   For each instruction in the `code` array except the last, the index of the opcode of the next instruction equals the index of the opcode of the current instruction plus the length of that instruction, including all its operands.
    
    The _wide_ instruction is treated like any other instruction for these purposes; the opcode specifying the operation that a _wide_ instruction is to modify is treated as one of the operands of that _wide_ instruction. That opcode must never be directly reachable by the computation.
    
*   The last byte of the last instruction in the `code` array must be the byte at index `code_length - 1`.
    

The static constraints on the operands of instructions in the `code` array are as follows:

*   The target of each jump and branch instruction (_jsr_, _jsr\_w_, _goto_, _goto\_w_, _ifeq_, _ifne_, _ifle_, _iflt_, _ifge_, _ifgt_, _ifnull_, _ifnonnull_, _if\_icmpeq_, _if\_icmpne_, _if\_icmple_, _if\_icmplt_, _if\_icmpge_, _if\_icmpgt_, _if\_acmpeq_, _if\_acmpne_) must be the opcode of an instruction within this method.
    
    The target of a jump or branch instruction must never be the opcode used to specify the operation to be modified by a _wide_ instruction; a jump or branch target may be the _wide_ instruction itself.
    
*   Each target, including the default, of each _tableswitch_ instruction must be the opcode of an instruction within this method.
    
    Each _tableswitch_ instruction must have a number of entries in its jump table that is consistent with the value of its _low_ and _high_ jump table operands, and its _low_ value must be less than or equal to its _high_ value.
    
    No target of a _tableswitch_ instruction may be the opcode used to specify the operation to be modified by a _wide_ instruction; a _tableswitch_ target may be a _wide_ instruction itself.
    
*   Each target, including the default, of each _lookupswitch_ instruction must be the opcode of an instruction within this method.
    
    Each _lookupswitch_ instruction must have a number of _match-offset_ pairs that is consistent with the value of its _npairs_ operand. The _match-offset_ pairs must be sorted in increasing numerical order by signed match value.
    
    No target of a _lookupswitch_ instruction may be the opcode used to specify the operation to be modified by a _wide_ instruction; a _lookupswitch_ target may be a _wide_ instruction itself.
    
*   The operands of each _ldc_ instruction and each _ldc\_w_ instruction must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The constant pool entry referenced by that index must be loadable ([§4.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4 "4.4. The Constant Pool")), and not any of the following:
    
    *   An entry of kind `CONSTANT_Long` or `CONSTANT_Double`.
        
    *   An entry of kind `CONSTANT_Dynamic` that references a `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure which indicates a descriptor of `J` (denoting `long`) or `D` (denoting `double`).
        
    
*   The operands of each _ldc2\_w_ instruction must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The constant pool entry referenced by that index must be loadable, and in particular one of the following:
    
    *   An entry of kind `CONSTANT_Long` or `CONSTANT_Double`.
        
    *   An entry of kind `CONSTANT_Dynamic` that references a `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure which indicates a descriptor of `J` (denoting `long`) or `D` (denoting `double`).
        
    
    The subsequent constant pool index must also be a valid index into the constant pool, and the constant pool entry at that index must not be used.
    
*   The operands of each _getfield_, _putfield_, _getstatic_, and _putstatic_ instruction must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The constant pool entry referenced by that index must be of kind `CONSTANT_Fieldref`.
    
*   The _indexbyte_ operands of each _invokevirtual_ instruction must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The constant pool entry referenced by that index must be of kind `CONSTANT_Methodref`.
    
*   The _indexbyte_ operands of each _invokespecial_ and _invokestatic_ instruction must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. If the `class` file version number is less than 52.0, the constant pool entry referenced by that index must be of kind `CONSTANT_Methodref`; if the `class` file version number is 52.0 or above, the constant pool entry referenced by that index must be of kind `CONSTANT_Methodref` or `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref`.
    
*   The _indexbyte_ operands of each _invokeinterface_ instruction must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The constant pool entry referenced by that index must be of kind `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref`.
    
    The value of the _count_ operand of each _invokeinterface_ instruction must reflect the number of local variables necessary to store the arguments to be passed to the interface method, as implied by the descriptor of the `CONSTANT_NameAndType_info` structure referenced by the `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref` constant pool entry.
    
    The fourth operand byte of each _invokeinterface_ instruction must have the value zero.
    
*   The _indexbyte_ operands of each _invokedynamic_ instruction must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The constant pool entry referenced by that index must be of kind `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic`.
    
    The third and fourth operand bytes of each _invokedynamic_ instruction must have the value zero.
    
*   Only the _invokespecial_ instruction is allowed to invoke an instance initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")).
    
    No other method whose name begins with the character '`<`' ('`\u003c`') may be called by the method invocation instructions. In particular, the class or interface initialization method specially named `<clinit>` is never called explicitly from Java Virtual Machine instructions, but only implicitly by the Java Virtual Machine itself.
    
*   The operands of each _instanceof_, _checkcast_, _new_, and _anewarray_ instruction, and the _indexbyte_ operands of each _multianewarray_ instruction, must represent a valid index into the `constant_pool` table. The constant pool entry referenced by that index must be of kind `CONSTANT_Class`.
    
*   No _new_ instruction may reference a constant pool entry of kind `CONSTANT_Class` that represents an array type ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")). The _new_ instruction cannot be used to create an array.
    
*   No _anewarray_ instruction may be used to create an array of more than 255 dimensions.
    
*   A _multianewarray_ instruction must be used only to create an array of a type that has at least as many dimensions as the value of its _dimensions_ operand. That is, while a _multianewarray_ instruction is not required to create all of the dimensions of the array type referenced by its _indexbyte_ operands, it must not attempt to create more dimensions than are in the array type.
    
    The _dimensions_ operand of each _multianewarray_ instruction must not be zero.
    
*   The _atype_ operand of each _newarray_ instruction must take one of the values `T_BOOLEAN` (4), `T_CHAR` (5), `T_FLOAT` (6), `T_DOUBLE` (7), `T_BYTE` (8), `T_SHORT` (9), `T_INT` (10), or `T_LONG` (11).
    
*   The _index_ operand of each _iload_, _fload_, _aload_, _istore_, _fstore_, _astore_, _iinc_, and _ret_ instruction must be a non-negative integer no greater than `max_locals - 1`.
    
    The implicit index of each _iload\_<n>_, _fload\_<n>_, _aload\_<n>_, _istore\_<n>_, _fstore\_<n>_, and _astore\_<n>_ instruction must be no greater than `max_locals - 1`.
    
*   The _index_ operand of each _lload_, _dload_, _lstore_, and _dstore_ instruction must be no greater than `max_locals - 2`.
    
    The implicit index of each _lload\_<n>_, _dload\_<n>_, _lstore\_<n>_, and _dstore\_<n>_ instruction must be no greater than `max_locals - 2`.
    
*   The _indexbyte_ operands of each _wide_ instruction modifying an _iload_, _fload_, _aload_, _istore_, _fstore_, _astore_, _iinc_, or _ret_ instruction must represent a non-negative integer no greater than `max_locals - 1`.
    
    The _indexbyte_ operands of each _wide_ instruction modifying an _lload_, _dload_, _lstore_, or _dstore_ instruction must represent a non-negative integer no greater than `max_locals - 2`.
    

### 4.9.2. Structural Constraints

The structural constraints on the `code` array specify constraints on relationships between Java Virtual Machine instructions. The structural constraints are as follows:

*   Each instruction must only be executed with the appropriate type and number of arguments in the operand stack and local variable array, regardless of the execution path that leads to its invocation.
    
    An instruction operating on values of type `int` is also permitted to operate on values of type `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, and `short`.
    
    As noted in [§2.3.4](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3.4 "2.3.4. The boolean Type") and [§2.11.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.11.1 "2.11.1. Types and the Java Virtual Machine"), the Java Virtual Machine internally converts values of types `boolean`, `byte`, `short`, and `char` to type `int`.)
    
*   If an instruction can be executed along several different execution paths, the operand stack must have the same depth ([§2.6.2](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6.2 "2.6.2. Operand Stacks")) prior to the execution of the instruction, regardless of the path taken.
    
*   At no point during execution can the operand stack grow to a depth greater than that implied by the `max_stack` item.
    
*   At no point during execution can more values be popped from the operand stack than it contains.
    
*   At no point during execution can the order of the local variable pair holding a value of type `long` or `double` be reversed or the pair split up. At no point can the local variables of such a pair be operated on individually.
    
*   No local variable (or local variable pair, in the case of a value of type `long` or `double`) can be accessed before it is assigned a value.
    
*   Each _invokespecial_ instruction must name one of the following:
    
    *   an instance initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods"))
        
    *   a method in the current class or interface
        
    *   a method in a superclass of the current class
        
    *   a method in a direct superinterface of the current class or interface
        
    *   a method in `Object`
        
    
    If an _invokespecial_ instruction names an instance initialization method, then the target reference on the operand stack must be an uninitialized class instance. An instance initialization method must never be invoked on an initialized class instance. In addition:
    
    *   If the target reference on the operand stack is _an uninitialized class instance for the current class_, then _invokespecial_ must name an instance initialization method from the current class or its direct superclass.
        
    *   If an _invokespecial_ instruction names an instance initialization method and the target reference on the operand stack is _a class instance created by an earlier _new_ instruction_, then _invokespecial_ must name an instance initialization method from the class of that class instance.
        
    
    If an _invokespecial_ instruction names a method which is not an instance initialization method, then the target reference on the operand stack must be a class instance whose type is assignment compatible with the current class (JLS §5.2).
    
    The general rule for _invokespecial_ is that the class or interface named by _invokespecial_ must be be "above" the caller class or interface, while the receiver object targeted by _invokespecial_ must be "at" or "below" the caller class or interface. The latter clause is especially important: a class or interface can only perform invokespecial on its own objects. See [§_invokespecial_](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9.invokespecial "invokespecial") for an explanation of how the latter clause is implemented in Prolog.
    
*   Each instance initialization method, except for the instance initialization method derived from the constructor of class `Object`, must call either another instance initialization method of `this` or an instance initialization method of its direct superclass `super` before its instance members are _accessed_.
    
    However, instance fields of `this` that are declared in the current class may be _assigned_ by _putfield_ before calling any instance initialization method.
    
*   When any instance method is invoked or when any instance variable is accessed, the class instance that contains the instance method or instance variable must already be initialized.
    
*   If there is an uninitialized class instance in a local variable in code protected by an exception handler, then (i) if the handler is inside an `<init>` method, the handler must throw an exception or loop forever; and (ii) if the handler is not inside an `<init>` method, the uninitialized class instance must remain uninitialized.
    
*   There must never be an uninitialized class instance on the operand stack or in a local variable when a _jsr_ or _jsr\_w_ instruction is executed.
    
*   The type of every class instance that is the target of a method invocation instruction (that is, the type of the target reference on the operand stack) must be assignment compatible with the class or interface type specified in the instruction.
    
*   The types of the arguments to each method invocation must be method invocation compatible with the method descriptor (JLS §5.3, [§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).
    
*   Each return instruction must match its method's return type:
    
    *   If the method returns a `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, or `int`, only the _ireturn_ instruction may be used.
        
    *   If the method returns a `float`, `long`, or `double`, only an _freturn_, _lreturn_, or _dreturn_ instruction, respectively, may be used.
        
    *   If the method returns a `reference` type, only an _areturn_ instruction may be used, and the type of the returned value must be assignment compatible with the return descriptor of the method ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")).
        
    *   All instance initialization methods, class or interface initialization methods, and methods declared to return `void` must use only the _return_ instruction.
        
    
*   The type of every class instance accessed by a _getfield_ instruction or modified by a _putfield_ instruction (that is, the type of the target reference on the operand stack) must be assignment compatible with the class type specified in the instruction.
    
*   The type of every value stored by a _putfield_ or _putstatic_ instruction must be compatible with the descriptor of the field ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors")) of the class instance or class being stored into:
    
    *   If the descriptor type is `boolean`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, or `int`, then the value must be an `int`.
        
    *   If the descriptor type is `float`, `long`, or `double`, then the value must be a `float`, `long`, or `double`, respectively.
        
    *   If the descriptor type is a `reference` type, then the value must be of a type that is assignment compatible with the descriptor type.
        
    
*   The type of every value stored into an array by an _aastore_ instruction must be a `reference` type.
    
    The component type of the array being stored into by the _aastore_ instruction must also be a `reference` type.
    
*   Each _athrow_ instruction must throw only values that are instances of class `Throwable` or of subclasses of `Throwable`.
    
    Each class mentioned in a `catch_type` item of the `exception_table` array of the method's `Code_attribute` structure must be `Throwable` or a subclass of `Throwable`.
    
*   If _getfield_ or _putfield_ is used to access a `protected` field declared in a superclass that is a member of a different run-time package than the current class, then the type of the class instance being accessed (that is, the type of the target reference on the operand stack) must be assignment compatible with the current class.
    
    If _invokevirtual_ or _invokespecial_ is used to access a `protected` method declared in a superclass that is a member of a different run-time package than the current class, then the type of the class instance being accessed (that is, the type of the target reference on the operand stack) must be assignment compatible with the current class.
    
*   Execution never falls off the bottom of the `code` array.
    
*   No return address (a value of type `returnAddress`) may be loaded from a local variable.
    
*   The instruction following each _jsr_ or _jsr\_w_ instruction may be returned to only by a single _ret_ instruction.
    
*   No _jsr_ or _jsr\_w_ instruction that is returned to may be used to recursively call a subroutine if that subroutine is already present in the subroutine call chain. (Subroutines can be nested when using `try`\-`finally` constructs from within a `finally` clause.)
    
*   Each instance of type `returnAddress` can be returned to at most once.
    
    If a _ret_ instruction returns to a point in the subroutine call chain above the _ret_ instruction corresponding to a given instance of type `returnAddress`, then that instance can never be used as a return address.
    

4.10. Verification of `class` Files
-----------------------------------

Even though a compiler for the Java programming language must only produce `class` files that satisfy all the static and structural constraints in the previous sections, the Java Virtual Machine has no guarantee that any file it is asked to load was generated by that compiler or is properly formed. Applications such as web browsers do not download source code, which they then compile; these applications download already-compiled `class` files. The browser needs to determine whether the `class` file was produced by a trustworthy compiler or by an adversary attempting to exploit the Java Virtual Machine.

An additional problem with compile-time checking is version skew. A user may have successfully compiled a class, say `PurchaseStockOptions`, to be a subclass of `TradingClass`. But the definition of `TradingClass` might have changed since the time the class was compiled in a way that is not compatible with pre-existing binaries. Methods might have been deleted or had their return types or modifiers changed. Fields might have changed types or changed from instance variables to class variables. The access modifiers of a method or variable may have changed from `public` to `private`. For a discussion of these issues, see Chapter 13, "Binary Compatibility," in _The Java Language Specification, Java SE 19 Edition_.

Because of these potential problems, the Java Virtual Machine needs to verify for itself that the desired constraints are satisfied by the `class` files it attempts to incorporate. A Java Virtual Machine implementation verifies that each `class` file satisfies the necessary constraints at linking time ([§5.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4 "5.4. Linking")).

Link-time verification enhances the performance of the run-time interpreter. Expensive checks that would otherwise have to be performed to verify constraints at run time for each interpreted instruction can be eliminated. The Java Virtual Machine can assume that these checks have already been performed. For example, the Java Virtual Machine will already know the following:

*   There are no operand stack overflows or underflows.
    
*   All local variable uses and stores are valid.
    
*   The arguments to all the Java Virtual Machine instructions are of valid types.
    

There are two strategies that Java Virtual Machine implementations may use for verification:

*   Verification by type checking must be used to verify `class` files whose version number is greater than or equal to 50.0.
    
*   Verification by type inference must be supported by all Java Virtual Machine implementations, except those conforming to the Java ME CLDC and Java Card profiles, in order to verify `class` files whose version number is less than 50.0.
    
    Verification on Java Virtual Machine implementations supporting the Java ME CLDC and Java Card profiles is governed by their respective specifications.
    

In both strategies, verification is mainly concerned with enforcing the static and structural constraints from [§4.9](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.9 "4.9. Constraints on Java Virtual Machine Code") on the `code` array of the `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). However, there are three additional checks outside the `Code` attribute which must be performed during verification:

*   Ensuring that `final` classes are not subclassed.
    
*   Ensuring that `final` methods are not overridden ([§5.4.5](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.5 "5.4.5. Method Overriding")).
    
*   Checking that every class (except `Object`) has a direct superclass.
    

### 4.10.1. Verification by Type Checking

A `class` file whose version number is 50.0 or above ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")) must be verified using the type checking rules given in this section.

If, and only if, a `class` file's version number equals 50.0, then if the type checking fails, a Java Virtual Machine implementation may choose to attempt to perform verification by type inference ([§4.10.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.2 "4.10.2. Verification by Type Inference")).

This is a pragmatic adjustment, designed to ease the transition to the new verification discipline. Many tools that manipulate `class` files may alter the bytecodes of a method in a manner that requires adjustment of the method's stack map frames. If a tool does not make the necessary adjustments to the stack map frames, type checking may fail even though the bytecode is in principle valid (and would consequently verify under the old type inference scheme). To allow implementors time to adapt their tools, Java Virtual Machine implementations may fall back to the older verification discipline, but only for a limited time.

In cases where type checking fails but type inference is invoked and succeeds, a certain performance penalty is expected. Such a penalty is unavoidable. It also should serve as a signal to tool vendors that their output needs to be adjusted, and provides vendors with additional incentive to make these adjustments.

In summary, failover to verification by type inference supports both the gradual addition of stack map frames to the Java SE Platform (if they are not present in a version 50.0 `class` file, failover is allowed) and the gradual removal of the _jsr_ and _jsr\_w_ instructions from the Java SE Platform (if they are present in a version 50.0 `class` file, failover is allowed).

If a Java Virtual Machine implementation ever attempts to perform verification by type inference on version 50.0 class files, it must do so in all cases where verification by type checking fails.

This means that a Java Virtual Machine implementation cannot choose to resort to type inference in once case and not in another. It must either reject `class` files that do not verify via type checking, or else consistently failover to the type inferencing verifier whenever type checking fails.

The type checker enforces type rules that are specified by means of Prolog clauses. English language text is used to describe the type rules in an informal way, while the Prolog clauses provide a formal specification.

The type checker requires a list of stack map frames for each method with a `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")). A list of stack map frames is given by the `StackMapTable` attribute ([§4.7.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.4 "4.7.4. The StackMapTable Attribute")) of a `Code` attribute. The intent is that a stack map frame must appear at the beginning of each basic block in a method. The stack map frame specifies the verification type of each operand stack entry and of each local variable at the start of each basic block. The type checker reads the stack map frames for each method with a `Code` attribute and uses these maps to generate a proof of the type safety of the instructions in the `Code` attribute.

A class is type safe if all its methods are type safe, and it does not subclass a `final` class.

```
classIsTypeSafe(Class) :-
    classClassName(Class, Name), 
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    superclassChain(Name, L, Chain),
    Chain \\= \[\],
    classSuperClassName(Class, SuperclassName),
    loadedClass(SuperclassName, L, Superclass),
    classIsNotFinal(Superclass),	 
    classMethods(Class, Methods), 
    checklist(methodIsTypeSafe(Class), Methods).

```
```
classIsTypeSafe(Class) :-
    classClassName(Class, 'java/lang/Object'),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    isBootstrapLoader(L),
    classMethods(Class, Methods), 
    checklist(methodIsTypeSafe(Class), Methods).

```

The Prolog predicate `classIsTypeSafe` assumes that `Class` is a Prolog term representing a binary class that has been successfully parsed and loaded. This specification does not mandate the precise structure of this term, but does require that certain predicates be defined upon it.

For example, we assume a predicate `classMethods(Class, Methods)` that, given a term representing a class as described above as its first argument, binds its second argument to a list comprising all the methods of the class, represented in a convenient form described later.

Iff the predicate `classIsTypeSafe` is not true, the type checker must throw the exception `VerifyError` to indicate that the `class` file is malformed. Otherwise, the `class` file has type checked successfully and bytecode verification has completed successfully.

The rest of this section explains the process of type checking in detail:

*   First, we give Prolog predicates for core Java Virtual Machine artifacts like classes and methods ([§4.10.1.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.1 "4.10.1.1. Accessors for Java Virtual Machine Artifacts")).
    
*   Second, we specify the type system known to the type checker ([§4.10.1.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.2 "4.10.1.2. Verification Type System")).
    
*   Third, we specify the Prolog representation of instructions and stack map frames ([§4.10.1.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.3 "4.10.1.3. Instruction Representation"), [§4.10.1.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.4 "4.10.1.4. Stack Map Frames and Type Transitions")).
    
*   Fourth, we specify how a method is type checked, for methods without code ([§4.10.1.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.5 "4.10.1.5. Type Checking Abstract and Native Methods")) and methods with code ([§4.10.1.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.6 "4.10.1.6. Type Checking Methods with Code")).
    
*   Fifth, we discuss type checking issues common to all load and store instructions ([§4.10.1.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.7 "4.10.1.7. Type Checking Load and Store Instructions")), and also issues of access to `protected` members ([§4.10.1.8](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.8 "4.10.1.8. Type Checking for protected Members")).
    
*   Finally, we specify the rules to type check each instruction ([§4.10.1.9](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9 "4.10.1.9. Type Checking Instructions")).
    

#### 4.10.1.1. Accessors for Java Virtual Machine Artifacts

differentPackageName(Class1, Class2)

True iff the package names of `Class1` and `Class2` are different.

When type checking a method's body, it is convenient to access information about the method. For this purpose, we define an _environment_, a six-tuple consisting of:

*   a class
    
*   a method
    
*   the declared return type of the method
    
*   the instructions in a method
    
*   the maximal size of the operand stack
    
*   a list of exception handlers
    

We specify accessors to extract information from the environment.

```
allInstructions(Environment, Instructions) :-
    Environment = environment(\_Class, \_Method, \_ReturnType,
                              Instructions, \_, \_).

exceptionHandlers(Environment, Handlers) :-
    Environment = environment(\_Class, \_Method, \_ReturnType,
                              \_Instructions, \_, Handlers).

maxOperandStackLength(Environment, MaxStack) :-
    Environment = environment(\_Class, \_Method, \_ReturnType,
                              \_Instructions, MaxStack, \_Handlers).

thisClass(Environment, class(ClassName, L)) :-
    Environment = environment(Class, \_Method, \_ReturnType,
                              \_Instructions, \_, \_),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    classClassName(Class, ClassName).

thisMethodReturnType(Environment, ReturnType) :-
    Environment = environment(\_Class, \_Method, ReturnType,
                              \_Instructions, \_, \_).

```

We specify additional predicates to extract higher-level information from the environment.

```
offsetStackFrame(Environment, Offset, StackFrame) :-
    allInstructions(Environment, Instructions),
    member(stackMap(Offset, StackFrame), Instructions).

currentClassLoader(Environment, Loader) :-
    thisClass(Environment, class(\_, Loader)).

```

Finally, we specify a general predicate used throughout the type rules:

```
notMember(\_, \[\]).
notMember(X, \[A | More\]) :- X \\= A, notMember(X, More).

```

The principle guiding the determination as to which accessors are stipulated and which are fully specified is that we do not want to over-specify the representation of the `class` file. Providing specific accessors to the `Class` or `Method` term would force us to completely specify the format for a Prolog term representing the `class` file.

#### 4.10.1.2. Verification Type System

The type checker enforces a type system based upon a hierarchy of _verification types_, illustrated below.

```
Verification type hierarchy:

                             top
                 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_/\\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
                /                          \\
               /                            \\
            oneWord                       twoWord
           /   |   \\                     /       \\
          /    |    \\                   /         \\
        int  float  reference        long        double
                     /     \\
                    /       \\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
                   /                      \\
                  /                        \\
           uninitialized                    +------------------+
            /         \\                     |  Java reference  |
           /           \\                    |  type hierarchy  |
uninitializedThis  uninitialized(Offset)    +------------------+  
                                                     |
                                                     |
                                                    null

```

Most verification types have a direct correspondence with the primitive and reference types represented by field descriptors in [Table 4.3-A](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2-200 "Table 4.3-A. Interpretation of field descriptors"):

*   The primitive types `double`, `float`, `int`, and `long` (field descriptors `D`, `F`, `I`, `J`) each correspond to the verification type of the same name.
    
*   The primitive types `byte`, `char`, `short`, and `boolean` (field descriptors `B`, `C`, `S`, `Z`) all correspond to the verification type `int`.
    
*   Class and interface types (field descriptors beginning `L`) correspond to verification types that use the functor `class`. The verification type `class(_N_, _L_)` represents the class whose binary name is `_N_` as loaded by the loader `_L_`. Note that `_L_` is an initiating loader ([§5.3](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.3 "5.3. Creation and Loading")) of the class represented by `class(_N_, _L_)` and may, or may not, be the class's defining loader.
    
    For example, the class type `Object` would be represented as `class('java/lang/Object', BL)`, where `BL` is the bootstrap loader.
    
*   Array types (field descriptors beginning `[`) correspond to verification types that use the functor `arrayOf`. Note that the primitive types `byte`, `char`, `short`, and `boolean` do not correspond to verification types, but an array type whose element type is `byte`, `char`, `short`, or `boolean` _does_ correspond to a verification type; such verification types support the _baload_, _bastore_, _caload_, _castore_, _saload_, _sastore_, and _newarray_ instructions.
    
    *   The verification type `arrayOf(_T_)` represents the array type whose component type is the verification type `_T_`.
        
    *   The verification type `arrayOf(byte)` represents the array type whose element type is `byte`.
        
    *   The verification type `arrayOf(char)` represents the array type whose element type is `char`.
        
    *   The verification type `arrayOf(short)` represents the array type whose element type is `short`.
        
    *   The verification type `arrayOf(boolean)` represents the array type whose element type is `boolean`.
        
    
    For example, the array types `int[]` and `Object[]` would be represented by the verification types `arrayOf(int)` and `arrayOf(class('java/lang/Object', BL))` respectively. The array types `byte``[]` and `boolean``[]``[]` would be represented by the verification types `arrayOf(byte)` and `arrayOf(arrayOf(boolean))` respectively.
    

The remaining verification types are described as follows:

*   The verification types `top`, `oneWord`, `twoWord`, and `reference` are represented in Prolog as atoms whose name denotes the verification type in question.
    
*   The verification type `uninitialized(Offset)` is represented by applying the functor `uninitialized` to an argument representing the numerical value of the `Offset`.
    

The subtyping rules for verification types are as follows.

Subtyping is reflexive.

```
isAssignable(X, X).

```

The verification types which are not reference types in the Java programming language have subtype rules of the form:

```
isAssignable(v, X) :- isAssignable(the\_direct\_supertype\_of\_v, X).

```

That is, `v` is a subtype of `X` if the direct supertype of `v` is a subtype of `X`. The rules are:

```
isAssignable(oneWord, top).
isAssignable(twoWord, top).

isAssignable(int, X)    :- isAssignable(oneWord, X).
isAssignable(float, X)  :- isAssignable(oneWord, X).
isAssignable(long, X)   :- isAssignable(twoWord, X).
isAssignable(double, X) :- isAssignable(twoWord, X).

isAssignable(reference, X)   :- isAssignable(oneWord, X).
isAssignable(class(\_, \_), X) :- isAssignable(reference, X).
isAssignable(arrayOf(\_), X)  :- isAssignable(reference, X).

isAssignable(uninitialized, X)     :- isAssignable(reference, X).
isAssignable(uninitializedThis, X) :- isAssignable(uninitialized, X).
isAssignable(uninitialized(\_), X)  :- isAssignable(uninitialized, X).

isAssignable(null, class(\_, \_)).
isAssignable(null, arrayOf(\_)).
isAssignable(null, X) :- isAssignable(class('java/lang/Object', BL), X),
                         isBootstrapLoader(BL).

```

These subtype rules are not necessarily the most obvious formulation of subtyping. There is a clear split between subtyping rules for reference types in the Java programming language, and rules for the remaining verification types. The split allows us to state general subtyping relations between Java programming language reference types and other verification types. These relations hold independently of a Java reference type's position in the type hierarchy, and help to prevent excessive class loading by a Java Virtual Machine implementation. For example, we do not want to start climbing the Java superclass hierarchy in response to a query of the form `class(foo, L) <: twoWord`.

We also have a rule that says subtyping is reflexive, so together these rules cover most verification types that are not reference types in the Java programming language.

Subtype rules for the reference types in the Java programming language are specified recursively with `isJavaAssignable`.

```
isAssignable(class(X, Lx), class(Y, Ly)) :-
    isJavaAssignable(class(X, Lx), class(Y, Ly)).

isAssignable(arrayOf(X), class(Y, L)) :-
    isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), class(Y, L)).

isAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)) :-
    isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)).

```

For assignments, interfaces are treated like `Object`.

```
isJavaAssignable(class(\_, \_), class(To, L)) :-
    loadedClass(To, L, ToClass),
    classIsInterface(ToClass).

isJavaAssignable(From, To) :-
    isJavaSubclassOf(From, To).

```

Array types are subtypes of `Object`. The intent is also that array types are subtypes of `Cloneable` and `java.io.Serializable`.

```
isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(\_), class('java/lang/Object', BL)) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(\_), X) :-
    isArrayInterface(X).

isArrayInterface(class('java/lang/Cloneable', BL)) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

isArrayInterface(class('java/io/Serializable', BL)) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

```

Subtyping between arrays of primitive type is the identity relation.

```
isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)) :-
    atom(X),
    atom(Y),
    X = Y.

```

Subtyping between arrays of reference type is covariant.

```
isJavaAssignable(arrayOf(X), arrayOf(Y)) :-
    compound(X), compound(Y), isJavaAssignable(X, Y).

```

Subclassing is reflexive.

```
isJavaSubclassOf(class(SubclassName, L), class(SubclassName, L)).

```
```
isJavaSubclassOf(class(SubclassName, LSub), class(SuperclassName, LSuper)) :-
    superclassChain(SubclassName, LSub, Chain),
    member(class(SuperclassName, L), Chain),
    loadedClass(SuperclassName, L, Sup),
    loadedClass(SuperclassName, LSuper, Sup).

superclassChain(ClassName, L, \[class(SuperclassName, Ls) | Rest\]) :-
    loadedClass(ClassName, L, Class),
    classSuperClassName(Class, SuperclassName),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, Ls),
    superclassChain(SuperclassName, Ls, Rest).

superclassChain('java/lang/Object', L, \[\]) :-
    loadedClass('java/lang/Object', L, Class),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, BL),
    isBootstrapLoader(BL).

```

#### 4.10.1.3. Instruction Representation

Individual bytecode instructions are represented in Prolog as terms whose functor is the name of the instruction and whose arguments are its parsed operands.

For example, an _aload_ instruction is represented as the term `aload(N)`, which includes the index `N` that is the operand of the instruction.

The instructions as a whole are represented as a list of terms of the form:

```
instruction(Offset, AnInstruction)

```

For example, `instruction(21, aload(1))`.

The order of instructions in this list must be the same as in the `class` file.

Some instructions have operands that refer to entries in the `constant_pool` table representing fields, methods, and dynamically-computed call sites. Such entries are represented as functor applications of the form:

*   `field(FieldClassName, FieldName, FieldDescriptor)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Fieldref_info` structure ([§4.4.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2 "4.4.2. The CONSTANT_Fieldref_info, CONSTANT_Methodref_info, and CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info Structures")).
    
    `FieldClassName` is the name of the class referenced by the `class_index` item in the structure. `FieldName` and `FieldDescriptor` correspond to the name and field descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the structure.
    
*   `method(MethodClassName, MethodName, MethodDescriptor)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` structure ([§4.4.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2 "4.4.2. The CONSTANT_Fieldref_info, CONSTANT_Methodref_info, and CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info Structures")).
    
    `MethodClassName` is the name of the class referenced by the `class_index` item of the structure. `MethodName` and `MethodDescriptor` correspond to the name and method descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the structure.
    
*   `imethod(MethodIntfName, MethodName, MethodDescriptor)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info` structure ([§4.4.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.2 "4.4.2. The CONSTANT_Fieldref_info, CONSTANT_Methodref_info, and CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info Structures")).
    
    `MethodIntfName` is the name of the interface referenced by the `class_index` item of the structure. `MethodName` and `MethodDescriptor` correspond to the name and method descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the structure.
    
*   `dmethod(CallSiteName, MethodDescriptor)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info` structure ([§4.4.10](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.10 "4.4.10. The CONSTANT_Dynamic_info and CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info Structures")).
    
    `CallSiteName` and `MethodDescriptor` correspond to the name and method descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the structure. (The `bootstrap_method_attr_index` item is irrelevant to verification.)
    

For clarity, we assume that field and method descriptors ([§4.3.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.2 "4.3.2. Field Descriptors"), [§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")) are mapped into more readable names: the leading `L` and trailing `;` are dropped from class names, and the _BaseType_ characters used for primitive types are mapped to the names of those types.

For example, a _getfield_ instruction whose operand refers to a constant pool entry representing a field `foo` of type `F` in class `Bar` would be represented as `getfield(field('Bar', 'foo', 'F'))`.

The _ldc_ instruction, among others, has an operand that refers to a _loadable_ entry in the `constant_pool` table. There are nine kinds of loadable entry (see [Table 4.4-C](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4-310 "Table 4.4-C. Loadable constant pool tags")), represented by functor applications of the following forms:

*   `int(Value)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Integer_info` structure ([§4.4.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.4 "4.4.4. The CONSTANT_Integer_info and CONSTANT_Float_info Structures")).
    
    `Value` is the `int` constant represented by the `bytes` item of the structure.
    
    For example, an _ldc_ instruction for loading the `int` constant 91 would be represented as `ldc(int(91))`.
    
*   `float(Value)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Float_info` structure ([§4.4.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.4 "4.4.4. The CONSTANT_Integer_info and CONSTANT_Float_info Structures")).
    
    `Value` is the `float` constant represented by the `bytes` item of the structure.
    
*   `long(Value)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Long_info` structure ([§4.4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.5 "4.4.5. The CONSTANT_Long_info and CONSTANT_Double_info Structures")).
    
    `Value` is the `long` constant represented by the `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items of the structure.
    
*   `double(Value)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Double_info` structure ([§4.4.5](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.5 "4.4.5. The CONSTANT_Long_info and CONSTANT_Double_info Structures")).
    
    `Value` is the `double` constant represented by the `high_bytes` and `low_bytes` items of the structure.
    
*   `class(ClassName)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure ([§4.4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.1 "4.4.1. The CONSTANT_Class_info Structure")).
    
    `ClassName` is the name of the class or interface referenced by the `name_index` item in the structure.
    
*   `string(Value)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_String_info` structure ([§4.4.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.3 "4.4.3. The CONSTANT_String_info Structure")).
    
    `Value` is the string referenced by the `string_index` item of the structure.
    
*   `methodHandle(Kind, Reference)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info` structure ([§4.4.8](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.8 "4.4.8. The CONSTANT_MethodHandle_info Structure")).
    
    `Kind` is the value of the `reference_kind` item of the structure. `Reference` is the value of the `reference_index` item of the structure.
    
*   `methodType(MethodDescriptor)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_MethodType_info` structure ([§4.4.9](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.9 "4.4.9. The CONSTANT_MethodType_info Structure")).
    
    `MethodDescriptor` is the method descriptor referenced by the `descriptor_index` item of the structure.
    
*   `dconstant(ConstantName, FieldDescriptor)` for a constant pool entry that is a `CONSTANT_Dynamic_info` structure ([§4.4.10](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.10 "4.4.10. The CONSTANT_Dynamic_info and CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic_info Structures")).
    
    `ConstantName` and `FieldDescriptor` correspond to the name and field descriptor referenced by the `name_and_type_index` item of the structure. (The `bootstrap_method_attr_index` item is irrelevant to verification.)
    

#### 4.10.1.4. Stack Map Frames and Type Transitions

Stack map frames are represented in Prolog as a list of terms of the form:

```
stackMap(Offset, TypeState)

```

where:

*   `Offset` is an integer indicating the bytecode offset at which the stack map frame applies ([§4.7.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.4 "4.7.4. The StackMapTable Attribute")).
    
    The order of bytecode offsets in this list must be the same as in the `class` file.
    
*   `TypeState` is the expected incoming type state for the instruction at `Offset`.
    

A _type state_ is a mapping from locations in the operand stack and local variables of a method to verification types. It has the form:

```
frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags)

```

where:

*   `Locals` is a list of verification types, such that the _i_'th element of the list (with 0-based indexing) represents the type of local variable _i_.
    
    Types of size 2 (`long` and `double`) are represented by two local variables ([§2.6.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6.1 "2.6.1. Local Variables")), with the first local variable being the type itself and the second local variable being `top` ([§4.10.1.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.7 "4.10.1.7. Type Checking Load and Store Instructions")).
    
*   `OperandStack` is a list of verification types, such that the first element of the list represents the type of the top of the operand stack, and the types of stack entries below the top follow in the list in the appropriate order.
    
    Types of size 2 (`long` and `double`) are represented by two stack entries, with the first entry being `top` and the second entry being the type itself.
    
    For example, a stack with a `double` value, an `int` value, and a `long` value is represented in a type state as a stack with five entries: `top` and `double` entries for the `double` value, an `int` entry for the `int` value, and `top` and `long` entries for the `long` value. Accordingly, `OperandStack` is the list `[top, double, int, top, long]`.
    
*   `Flags` is a list which may either be empty or have the single element `flagThisUninit`.
    
    If any local variable in `Locals` has the type `uninitializedThis`, then `Flags` has the single element `flagThisUninit`, otherwise `Flags` is an empty list.
    
    `flagThisUninit` is used in constructors to mark type states where initialization of `this` has not yet been completed. In such type states, it is illegal to return from the method.
    

Subtyping of verification types is extended pointwise to type states. The local variable array of a method has a fixed length by construction (see `methodInitialStackFrame` in [§4.10.1.6](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.6 "4.10.1.6. Type Checking Methods with Code")), but the operand stack grows and shrinks, so we require an explicit check on the length of the operand stacks whose assignability is desired for subtyping.

```
frameIsAssignable(frame(Locals1, StackMap1, Flags1),
                  frame(Locals2, StackMap2, Flags2)) :-
    length(StackMap1, StackMapLength),
    length(StackMap2, StackMapLength),
    maplist(isAssignable, Locals1, Locals2),
    maplist(isAssignable, StackMap1, StackMap2),
    subset(Flags1, Flags2).

```

Most of the type rules for individual instructions ([§4.10.1.9](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9 "4.10.1.9. Type Checking Instructions")) depend on the notion of a valid _type transition_. A type transition is _valid_ if one can pop a list of expected types off the incoming type state's operand stack and replace them with an expected result type, resulting in a new type state where the length of the operand stack does not exceed its declared maximum size.

```
validTypeTransition(Environment, ExpectedTypesOnStack, ResultType,
                    frame(Locals, InputOperandStack, Flags),
                    frame(Locals, NextOperandStack, Flags)) :-
    popMatchingList(InputOperandStack, ExpectedTypesOnStack,
                    InterimOperandStack),
    pushOperandStack(InterimOperandStack, ResultType, NextOperandStack),
    operandStackHasLegalLength(Environment, NextOperandStack).

```

Pop a list of types off the stack.

```
popMatchingList(OperandStack, \[\], OperandStack).
popMatchingList(OperandStack, \[P | Rest\], NewOperandStack) :-
    popMatchingType(OperandStack, P, TempOperandStack, \_ActualType),
    popMatchingList(TempOperandStack, Rest, NewOperandStack).

```

Pop an individual type off the stack. The exact behavior depends on the stack contents. If the logical top of the stack is some subtype of the specified type, `Type`, then pop it. If a type occupies two stack entries, then the logical top of the stack is really the type just below the top, and the top of the stack is the unusable type `top`.

```
popMatchingType(\[ActualType | OperandStack\],
                Type, OperandStack, ActualType) :-
    sizeOf(Type, 1),
    isAssignable(ActualType, Type).

popMatchingType(\[top, ActualType | OperandStack\],
                Type, OperandStack, ActualType) :-
    sizeOf(Type, 2),
    isAssignable(ActualType, Type).

sizeOf(X, 2) :- isAssignable(X, twoWord).
sizeOf(X, 1) :- isAssignable(X, oneWord).
sizeOf(top, 1).

```

Push a logical type onto the stack. The exact behavior varies with the size of the type. If the pushed type is of size 1, we just push it onto the stack. If the pushed type is of size 2, we push it, and then push `top`.

```
pushOperandStack(OperandStack, 'void', OperandStack).
pushOperandStack(OperandStack, Type, \[Type | OperandStack\]) :-
    sizeOf(Type, 1).
pushOperandStack(OperandStack, Type, \[top, Type | OperandStack\]) :-
    sizeOf(Type, 2).

```

The length of the operand stack must not exceed the declared maximum size.

```
operandStackHasLegalLength(Environment, OperandStack) :-
    length(OperandStack, Length),
    maxOperandStackLength(Environment, MaxStack),
    Length =< MaxStack.

```

The _dup_ instructions pop expected types off the incoming type state's operand stack and replace them with predefined result types, resulting in a new type state. However, these instructions are not defined in terms of type transitions because there is no need to match types by means of the subtyping relation. Instead, the _dup_ instructions manipulate the operand stack entirely in terms of the _category_ of types on the stack ([§2.11.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.11.1 "2.11.1. Types and the Java Virtual Machine")).

Category 1 types occupy a single stack entry. Popping a logical type of category 1, `Type`, off the stack is possible if the top of the stack is `Type` and `Type` is not `top` (otherwise it could denote the upper half of a category 2 type). The result is the incoming stack, with the top entry popped off.

```
popCategory1(\[Type | Rest\], Type, Rest) :-
    Type \\= top,
    sizeOf(Type, 1).

```

Category 2 types occupy two stack entries. Popping a logical type of category 2, `Type`, off the stack is possible if the top of the stack is type `top`, and the entry directly below it is `Type`. The result is the incoming stack, with the top two entries popped off.

```
popCategory2(\[top, Type | Rest\], Type, Rest) :-
    sizeOf(Type, 2).

```

The _dup_ instructions push a list of types onto the stack in essentially the same way as when a type is pushed for a valid type transition.

```
canSafelyPush(Environment, InputOperandStack, Type, OutputOperandStack) :-
    pushOperandStack(InputOperandStack, Type, OutputOperandStack),
    operandStackHasLegalLength(Environment, OutputOperandStack).

canSafelyPushList(Environment, InputOperandStack, Types,
                  OutputOperandStack) :-
    canPushList(InputOperandStack, Types, OutputOperandStack),
    operandStackHasLegalLength(Environment, OutputOperandStack).

canPushList(InputOperandStack, \[\], InputOperandStack).
canPushList(InputOperandStack, \[Type | Rest\], OutputOperandStack) :-
    pushOperandStack(InputOperandStack, Type, InterimOperandStack),
    canPushList(InterimOperandStack, Rest, OutputOperandStack).

```

Many of the type rules for individual instructions use the following clause to easily pop a list of types off the stack.

```
canPop(frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags), Types,
       frame(Locals, PoppedOperandStack, Flags)) :-
    popMatchingList(OperandStack, Types, PoppedOperandStack).

```

Finally, certain array instructions ([§_aaload_](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9.aaload "aaload"), [§_arraylength_](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9.arraylength "arraylength"), [§_baload_](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9.baload "baload"), [§_bastore_](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9.bastore "bastore")) peek at types on the operand stack in order to check they are array types. The following clause accesses the _i_'th element of the operand stack from a type state.

```
nth1OperandStackIs(_i_, frame(\_Locals, OperandStack, \_Flags), Element) :-
    nth1(_i_, OperandStack, Element).

```

#### 4.10.1.5. Type Checking Abstract and Native Methods

`abstract` methods and `native` methods are considered to be type safe if they do not override a `final` method.

```
methodIsTypeSafe(Class, Method) :-
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(Class, Method),
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    member(abstract, AccessFlags).

methodIsTypeSafe(Class, Method) :-
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(Class, Method),
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    member(native, AccessFlags).

```

`private` methods and `static` methods are orthogonal to dynamic method dispatch, so they never override other methods ([§5.4.5](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.5 "5.4.5. Method Overriding")).

```
doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(class('java/lang/Object', L), Method) :-
    isBootstrapLoader(L).

doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(Class, Method) :-
    isPrivate(Method, Class).

doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(Class, Method) :-
    isStatic(Method, Class).

doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(Class, Method) :-
    isNotPrivate(Method, Class),
    isNotStatic(Method, Class),
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethodOfSuperclass(Class, Method).

doesNotOverrideFinalMethodOfSuperclass(Class, Method) :-
    classSuperClassName(Class, SuperclassName),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    loadedClass(SuperclassName, L, Superclass),
    classMethods(Superclass, SuperMethodList),
    finalMethodNotOverridden(Method, Superclass, SuperMethodList).

```

`final` methods that are `private` and/or `static` are unusual, as `private` methods and `static` methods cannot be overridden per se. Therefore, if a `final` `private` method or a `final` `static` method is found, it was logically not overridden by another method.

```
finalMethodNotOverridden(Method, Superclass, SuperMethodList) :-
    methodName(Method, Name),
    methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor),
    member(method(\_, Name, Descriptor), SuperMethodList),
    isFinal(Method, Superclass),
    isPrivate(Method, Superclass).

finalMethodNotOverridden(Method, Superclass, SuperMethodList) :-
    methodName(Method, Name),
    methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor),
    member(method(\_, Name, Descriptor), SuperMethodList),
    isFinal(Method, Superclass),
    isStatic(Method, Superclass). 

```

If a non-`final` `private` method or a non-`final` `static` method is found, skip over it because it is orthogonal to overriding.

```
finalMethodNotOverridden(Method, Superclass, SuperMethodList) :-
    methodName(Method, Name),
    methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor),
    member(method(\_, Name, Descriptor), SuperMethodList),
    isNotFinal(Method, Superclass),
    isPrivate(Method, Superclass),
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethodOfSuperclass(Superclass, Method).

finalMethodNotOverridden(Method, Superclass, SuperMethodList) :-
    methodName(Method, Name),

    member(method(\_, Name, Descriptor), SuperMethodList),
    isNotFinal(Method, Superclass),
    isStatic(Method, Superclass),
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethodOfSuperclass(Superclass, Method).

```

If a non-`final`, non-`private`, non-`static` method is found, then indeed a `final` method was not overridden. Otherwise, recurse upwards.

```
finalMethodNotOverridden(Method, Superclass, SuperMethodList) :-
    methodName(Method, Name),
    methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor),
    member(method(\_, Name, Descriptor), SuperMethodList),
    isNotFinal(Method, Superclass),
    isNotStatic(Method, Superclass),
    isNotPrivate(Method, Superclass).

finalMethodNotOverridden(Method, Superclass, SuperMethodList) :-
    methodName(Method, Name),
    methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor),
    notMember(method(\_, Name, Descriptor), SuperMethodList),
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethodOfSuperclass(Superclass, Method).

```

#### 4.10.1.6. Type Checking Methods with Code

Non-`abstract`, non-`native` methods are type correct if they have code and the code is type correct.

```
methodIsTypeSafe(Class, Method) :-
    doesNotOverrideFinalMethod(Class, Method),
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    methodAttributes(Method, Attributes),
    notMember(native, AccessFlags),
    notMember(abstract, AccessFlags),
    member(attribute('Code', \_), Attributes),
    methodWithCodeIsTypeSafe(Class, Method).

```

A method with code is type safe if it is possible to merge the code and the stack map frames into a single stream such that each stack map frame precedes the instruction it corresponds to, and the merged stream is type correct. The method's exception handlers, if any, must also be legal.

```
methodWithCodeIsTypeSafe(Class, Method) :-
    parseCodeAttribute(Class, Method, FrameSize, MaxStack,
                       ParsedCode, Handlers, StackMap),
    mergeStackMapAndCode(StackMap, ParsedCode, MergedCode),
    methodInitialStackFrame(Class, Method, FrameSize, StackFrame, ReturnType),
    Environment = environment(Class, Method, ReturnType, MergedCode,
                              MaxStack, Handlers),
    handlersAreLegal(Environment),
    mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MergedCode, StackFrame).

```

Let us consider exception handlers first.

An exception handler is represented by a functor application of the form:

```
handler(Start, End, Target, ClassName)

```

whose arguments are, respectively, the start and end of the range of instructions covered by the handler, the first instruction of the handler code, and the name of the exception class that this handler is designed to handle.

An exception handler is _legal_ if its start (`Start`) is less than its end (`End`), there exists an instruction whose offset is equal to `Start`, there exists an instruction whose offset equals `End`, and the handler's exception class is assignable to the class `Throwable`. The exception class of a handler is `Throwable` if the handler's class entry is 0, otherwise it is the class named in the handler.

An additional requirement exists for a handler inside an `<init>` method if one of the instructions covered by the handler is _invokespecial_ of an `<init>` method. In this case, the fact that a handler is running means the object under construction is likely broken, so it is important that the handler does not swallow the exception and allow the enclosing `<init>` method to return normally to the caller. Accordingly, the handler is required to either complete abruptly by throwing an exception to the caller of the enclosing `<init>` method, or to loop forever.

```
handlersAreLegal(Environment) :-
    exceptionHandlers(Environment, Handlers),
    checklist(handlerIsLegal(Environment), Handlers).

handlerIsLegal(Environment, Handler) :-
    Handler = handler(Start, End, Target, \_),

    Environment = environment(\_Class, Method, \_, Instructions, \_, \_),
    isNotInit(Method).

notInitHandler(Environment, Handler) :-
    Environment = environment(\_Class, Method, \_, Instructions, \_, \_),
    isInit(Method),
    member(instruction(\_, invokespecial(CP)), Instructions),
    CP = method(MethodClassName, MethodName, Descriptor),
    MethodName \\= '`<init>`'. 


initHandlerIsLegal(Environment, Handler) :-
    isInitHandler(Environment, Handler),
    sublist(isApplicableInstruction(Target), Instructions,
            HandlerInstructions),
    noAttemptToReturnNormally(HandlerInstructions).

isInitHandler(Environment, Handler) :-
    Environment = environment(\_Class, Method, \_, Instructions, \_, \_),
    isInit(Method).
    member(instruction(\_, invokespecial(CP)), Instructions),
    CP = method(MethodClassName, '`<init>`', Descriptor).

isApplicableInstruction(HandlerStart, instruction(Offset, \_)) :-
    Offset >= HandlerStart.

noAttemptToReturnNormally(Instructions) :-
    notMember(instruction(\_, return), Instructions).

noAttemptToReturnNormally(Instructions) :-
    member(instruction(\_, athrow), Instructions). 

```

Let us now turn to the stream of instructions and stack map frames.

Merging instructions and stack map frames into a single stream involves four cases:

*   Merging an empty `StackMap` and a list of instructions yields the original list of instructions.
    
    ```
    mergeStackMapAndCode(\[\], CodeList, CodeList).
    
    ```
    
*   Given a list of stack map frames beginning with the type state for the instruction at `Offset`, and a list of instructions beginning at `Offset`, the merged list is the head of the stack map frame list, followed by the head of the instruction list, followed by the merge of the tails of the two lists.
    
    ```
    mergeStackMapAndCode(\[stackMap(Offset, Map) | RestMap\],
                         \[instruction(Offset, Parse) | RestCode\],
                         \[stackMap(Offset, Map),
                           instruction(Offset, Parse) | RestMerge\]) :-
        mergeStackMapAndCode(RestMap, RestCode, RestMerge).
    
    ```
    
*   Otherwise, given a list of stack map frames beginning with the type state for the instruction at `OffsetM`, and a list of instructions beginning at `OffsetP`, then, if `OffsetP < OffsetM`, the merged list consists of the head of the instruction list, followed by the merge of the stack map frame list and the tail of the instruction list.
    
    ```
    mergeStackMapAndCode(\[stackMap(OffsetM, Map) | RestMap\],
                         \[instruction(OffsetP, Parse) | RestCode\],
                         \[instruction(OffsetP, Parse) | RestMerge\]) :-
        OffsetP < OffsetM,
        mergeStackMapAndCode(\[stackMap(OffsetM, Map) | RestMap\],
                             RestCode, RestMerge).
    
    ```
    
*   Otherwise, the merge of the two lists is undefined. Since the instruction list has monotonically increasing offsets, the merge of the two lists is not defined unless every stack map frame offset has a corresponding instruction offset and the stack map frames are in monotonically increasing order.
    

To determine if the merged stream for a method is type correct, we first infer the method's initial type state.

The initial type state of a method consists of an empty operand stack and local variable types derived from the type of `this` and the arguments, as well as the appropriate flag, depending on whether this is an `<init>` method.

```
methodInitialStackFrame(Class, Method, FrameSize, frame(Locals, \[\], Flags),
                        ReturnType):-
    methodDescriptor(Method, Descriptor),
    parseMethodDescriptor(Descriptor, RawArgs, ReturnType),
    expandTypeList(RawArgs, Args),
    methodInitialThisType(Class, Method, ThisList),
    flags(ThisList, Flags),
    append(ThisList, Args, ThisArgs),
    expandToLength(ThisArgs, FrameSize, top, Locals).

```

Given a list of types, the following clause produces a list where every type of size 2 has been substituted by two entries: one for itself, and one `top` entry. The result then corresponds to the representation of the list as 32-bit words in the Java Virtual Machine.

```
expandTypeList(\[\], \[\]).
expandTypeList(\[Item | List\], \[Item | Result\]) :-
    sizeOf(Item, 1),
    expandTypeList(List, Result).
expandTypeList(\[Item | List\], \[Item, top | Result\]) :-
    sizeOf(Item, 2),
    expandTypeList(List, Result).

```
```
flags(\[uninitializedThis\], \[flagThisUninit\]).
flags(X, \[\]) :- X \\= \[uninitializedThis\].

expandToLength(List, Size, \_Filler, List) :-
    length(List, Size).
expandToLength(List, Size, Filler, Result) :-
    length(List, ListLength),
    ListLength < Size,
    Delta is Size - ListLength,
    length(Extra, Delta),
    checklist(=(Filler), Extra),
    append(List, Extra, Result).

```

For the initial type state of an instance method, we compute the type of `this` and put it in a list. The type of `this` in the `<init>` method of `Object` is `Object`; in other `<init>` methods, the type of `this` is `uninitializedThis`; otherwise, the type of `this` in an instance method is `class(N, L)` where `N` is the name of the class containing the method and `L` is its defining class loader.

For the initial type state of a static method, `this` is irrelevant, so the list is empty.

```
methodInitialThisType(\_Class, Method, \[\]) :-
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    member(static, AccessFlags),
    methodName(Method, MethodName),
    MethodName \\= '`<init>`'.

methodInitialThisType(Class, Method, \[This\]) :-
    methodAccessFlags(Method, AccessFlags),
    notMember(static, AccessFlags),
    instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, This).

instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, class('java/lang/Object', L)) :-
    methodName(Method, '`<init>`'), 
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    isBootstrapLoader(L),
    classClassName(Class, 'java/lang/Object').

instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, uninitializedThis) :-
    methodName(Method, '`<init>`'), 
    classClassName(Class, ClassName),
    classDefiningLoader(Class, CurrentLoader),
    superclassChain(ClassName, CurrentLoader, Chain),
    Chain \\= \[\].

instanceMethodInitialThisType(Class, Method, class(ClassName, L)) :-
    methodName(Method, MethodName),
    MethodName \\= '`<init>`',
    classDefiningLoader(Class, L),
    classClassName(Class, ClassName).

```

We now compute whether the merged stream for a method is type correct, using the method's initial type state:

*   If we have a stack map frame and an incoming type state, the type state must be assignable to the one in the stack map frame. We may then proceed to type check the rest of the stream with the type state given in the stack map frame.
    
    ```
    mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, \[stackMap(Offset, MapFrame) | MoreCode\],
                         frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags)) :-
        frameIsAssignable(frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags), MapFrame),
        mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MoreCode, MapFrame).
    
    ```
    
*   A merged code stream is type safe relative to an incoming type state `T` if it begins with an instruction `I` that is type safe relative to `T`, and `I` _satisfies_ its exception handlers (see below), and the tail of the stream is type safe given the type state following that execution of `I`.
    
    `NextStackFrame` indicates what falls through to the following instruction. For an unconditional branch instruction, it will have the special value `afterGoto`. `ExceptionStackFrame` indicates what is passed to exception handlers.
    
    ```
    mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, \[instruction(Offset, Parse) | MoreCode\],
                         frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags)) :-
        instructionIsTypeSafe(Parse, Environment, Offset,
                              frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags),
                              NextStackFrame, ExceptionStackFrame),
        instructionSatisfiesHandlers(Environment, Offset, ExceptionStackFrame),
        mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MoreCode, NextStackFrame).
    
    ```
    
*   After an unconditional branch (indicated by an incoming type state of `afterGoto`), if we have a stack map frame giving the type state for the following instructions, we can proceed and type check them using the type state provided by the stack map frame.
    
    ```
    mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, \[stackMap(Offset, MapFrame) | MoreCode\],
                         afterGoto) :-
        mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(Environment, MoreCode, MapFrame).
    
    ```
    
*   It is illegal to have code after an unconditional branch without a stack map frame being provided for it.
    
    ```
    mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(\_Environment, \[instruction(\_, \_) | \_MoreCode\],
                         afterGoto) :-
        write\_ln('No stack frame after unconditional branch'),
        fail.
    
    ```
    
*   If we have an unconditional branch at the end of the code, stop.
    
    ```
    mergedCodeIsTypeSafe(\_Environment, \[endOfCode(Offset)\],
                         afterGoto).
    
    ```
    

Branching to a target is type safe if the target has an associated stack frame, `Frame`, and the current stack frame, `StackFrame`, is assignable to `Frame`.

```
targetIsTypeSafe(Environment, StackFrame, Target) :-
    offsetStackFrame(Environment, Target, Frame),
    frameIsAssignable(StackFrame, Frame).

```

An instruction _satisfies its exception handlers_ if it satisfies every exception handler that is applicable to the instruction.

```
instructionSatisfiesHandlers(Environment, Offset, ExceptionStackFrame) :-
    exceptionHandlers(Environment, Handlers),
    sublist(isApplicableHandler(Offset), Handlers, ApplicableHandlers),
    checklist(instructionSatisfiesHandler(Environment, ExceptionStackFrame),
              ApplicableHandlers).

```

An exception handler is _applicable_ to an instruction if the offset of the instruction is greater or equal to the start of the handler's range and less than the end of the handler's range.

```
isApplicableHandler(Offset, handler(Start, End, \_Target, \_ClassName)) :-
    Offset >= Start,
    Offset < End.

```

An instruction _satisfies_ an exception handler if the instructions's outgoing type state is `ExcStackFrame`, and the handler's target (the initial instruction of the handler code) is type safe assuming an incoming type state `T`. The type state `T` is derived from `ExcStackFrame` by replacing the operand stack with a stack whose sole element is the handler's exception class.

```
instructionSatisfiesHandler(Environment, ExcStackFrame, Handler) :-
    Handler = handler(\_, \_, Target, \_),
    currentClassLoader(Environment, CurrentLoader),
    handlerExceptionClass(Handler, ExceptionClass, CurrentLoader), 
    /\* The stack consists of just the exception. \*/
    ExcStackFrame = frame(Locals, \_, Flags),
    TrueExcStackFrame = frame(Locals, \[ ExceptionClass \], Flags),
    operandStackHasLegalLength(Environment, TrueExcStackFrame),
    targetIsTypeSafe(Environment, TrueExcStackFrame, Target).

```

#### 4.10.1.7. Type Checking Load and Store Instructions

All load instructions are variations on a common pattern, varying the type of the value that the instruction loads.

Loading a value of type `Type` from local variable `Index` is type safe, if the type of that local variable is `ActualType`, `ActualType` is assignable to `Type`, and pushing `ActualType` onto the incoming operand stack is a valid type transition ([§4.10.1.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.4 "4.10.1.4. Stack Map Frames and Type Transitions")) that yields a new type state `NextStackFrame`. After execution of the load instruction, the type state will be `NextStackFrame`.

```
loadIsTypeSafe(Environment, Index, Type, StackFrame, NextStackFrame) :-
    StackFrame = frame(Locals, \_OperandStack, \_Flags),
    nth0(Index, Locals, ActualType),
    isAssignable(ActualType, Type),
    validTypeTransition(Environment, \[\], ActualType, StackFrame,
                        NextStackFrame).

```

All store instructions are variations on a common pattern, varying the type of the value that the instruction stores.

In general, a store instruction is type safe if the local variable it references is of a type that is a supertype of `Type`, and the top of the operand stack is of a subtype of `Type`, where `Type` is the type the instruction is designed to store.

More precisely, the store is type safe if one can pop a type `ActualType` that "matches" `Type` (that is, is a subtype of `Type`) off the operand stack ([§4.10.1.4](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.4 "4.10.1.4. Stack Map Frames and Type Transitions")), and then legally assign that type the local variable `LIndex`.

```
storeIsTypeSafe(\_Environment, Index, Type,
                frame(Locals, OperandStack, Flags),
                frame(NextLocals, NextOperandStack, Flags)) :-
    popMatchingType(OperandStack, Type, NextOperandStack, ActualType),
    modifyLocalVariable(Index, ActualType, Locals, NextLocals).

```

Given local variables `Locals`, modifying `Index` to have type `Type` results in the local variable list `NewLocals`. The modifications are somewhat involved, because some values (and their corresponding types) occupy two local variables. Hence, modifying `LN` may require modifying `LN+1` (because the type will occupy both the `N` and `N+1` slots) or `LN-1` (because local `N` used to be the upper half of the two word value/type starting at local `N-1`, and so local `N-1` must be invalidated), or both. This is described further below. We start at `L0` and count up.

```
modifyLocalVariable(Index, Type, Locals, NewLocals) :-
    modifyLocalVariable(0, Index, Type, Locals, NewLocals).

```

Given `LocalsRest`, the suffix of the local variable list starting at index `I`, modifying local variable `Index` to have type `Type` results in the local variable list suffix `NextLocalsRest`.

If `I < Index-1`, just copy the input to the output and recurse forward. If `I = Index-1`, the type of local `I` may change. This can occur if `LI` has a type of size 2. Once we set `LI+1` to the new type (and the corresponding value), the type/value of `LI` will be invalidated, as its upper half will be trashed. Then we recurse forward.

```
modifyLocalVariable(I, Index, Type,
                    \[Locals1 | LocalsRest\],
                    \[Locals1 | NextLocalsRest\] ) :-
    I < Index - 1, 
    I1 is I + 1,
    modifyLocalVariable(I1, Index, Type, LocalsRest, NextLocalsRest).

modifyLocalVariable(I, Index, Type,
                    \[Locals1 | LocalsRest\],
                    \[NextLocals1 | NextLocalsRest\] ) :-
    I =:= Index - 1,
    modifyPreIndexVariable(Locals1, NextLocals1),
    modifyLocalVariable(Index, Index, Type, LocalsRest, NextLocalsRest).

```

When we find the variable, and it only occupies one word, we change it to `Type` and we're done. When we find the variable, and it occupies two words, we change its type to `Type` and the next word to `top`.

```
modifyLocalVariable(Index, Index, Type,
                    \[\_ | LocalsRest\], \[Type | LocalsRest\]) :-
    sizeOf(Type, 1).

modifyLocalVariable(Index, Index, Type,
                    \[\_, \_ | LocalsRest\], \[Type, top | LocalsRest\]) :-
    sizeOf(Type, 2).

```

We refer to a local whose index immediately precedes a local whose type will be modified as a _pre-index variable_. The future type of a pre-index variable of type `InputType` is `Result`. If the type, `Type`, of the pre-index local is of size 1, it doesn't change. If the type of the pre-index local, `Type`, is 2, we need to mark the lower half of its two word value as unusable, by setting its type to `top`.

```
modifyPreIndexVariable(Type, Type) :- sizeOf(Type, 1).
modifyPreIndexVariable(Type, top) :- sizeOf(Type, 2).

```

#### 4.10.1.8. Type Checking for `protected` Members

All instructions that access members must contend with the rules concerning `protected` members. This section describes the `protected` check that corresponds to JLS §6.6.2.1.

The `protected` check applies only to `protected` members of superclasses of the current class. `protected` members in other classes will be caught by the access checking done at resolution ([§5.4.4](jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.4 "5.4.4. Access Control")). There are four cases:

*   If the name of a class is not the name of any superclass, it cannot be a superclass, and so it can safely be ignored.
    
    ```
    passesProtectedCheck(Environment, MemberClassName, MemberName,
                         MemberDescriptor, StackFrame) :-
        thisClass(Environment, class(CurrentClassName, CurrentLoader)),
        superclassChain(CurrentClassName, CurrentLoader, Chain),
        notMember(class(MemberClassName, \_), Chain).
    
    ```
    
*   If the `MemberClassName` is the same as the name of a superclass, the class being resolved may indeed be a superclass. In this case, if no superclass named `MemberClassName` in a different run-time package has a `protected` member named `MemberName` with descriptor `MemberDescriptor`, the `protected` check does not apply.
    
    This is because the actual class being resolved will either be one of these superclasses, in which case we know that it is either in the same run-time package, and the access is legal; or the member in question is not `protected` and the check does not apply; or it will be a subclass, in which case the check would succeed anyway; or it will be some other class in the same run-time package, in which case the access is legal and the check need not take place; or the verifier need not flag this as a problem, since it will be caught anyway because resolution will per force fail.
    
    ```
    passesProtectedCheck(Environment, MemberClassName, MemberName,
                         MemberDescriptor, StackFrame) :-
        thisClass(Environment, class(CurrentClassName, CurrentLoader)),
        superclassChain(CurrentClassName, CurrentLoader, Chain),
        member(class(MemberClassName, \_), Chain),
        classesInOtherPkgWithProtectedMember(
          class(CurrentClassName, CurrentLoader),

#### 4.10.1.9. Type Checking Instructions

In general, the type rule for an instruction is given relative to an environment `Environment` that defines the class and method in which the instruction occurs ([§4.10.1.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.1 "4.10.1.1. Accessors for Java Virtual Machine Artifacts")), and the offset `Offset` within the method at which the instruction occurs. The rule states that if the incoming type state `StackFrame` fulfills certain requirements, then:

*   The instruction is type safe.
    
*   It is provable that the type state after the instruction completes normally has a particular form given by `NextStackFrame`, and that the type state after the instruction completes abruptly is given by `ExceptionStackFrame`.
    
    The type state after an instruction completes abruptly is the same as the incoming type state, except that the operand stack is empty.
    
    ```
    exceptionStackFrame(StackFrame, ExceptionStackFrame) :-
        StackFrame = frame(Locals, \_OperandStack, Flags),
        ExceptionStackFrame = frame(Locals, \[\], Flags).
        
    ```
    

Many instructions have type rules that are completely isomorphic to the rules for other instructions. If an instruction `b1` is isomorphic to another instruction `b2`, then the type rule for `b1` is the same as the type rule for `b2`.

```
instructionIsTypeSafe(Instruction, Environment, Offset, StackFrame,
                      NextStackFrame, ExceptionStackFrame) :-
    instructionHasEquivalentTypeRule(Instruction, IsomorphicInstruction),
    instructionIsTypeSafe(IsomorphicInstruction, Environment, Offset,
                          StackFrame, NextStackFrame,
                          ExceptionStackFrame).

```

The English language description of each rule is intended to be readable, intuitive, and concise. As such, the description avoids repeating all the contextual assumptions given above. In particular:

*   The description does not explicitly mention the environment.
    
*   When the description speaks of the operand stack or local variables in the following, it is referring to the operand stack and local variable components of a type state: either the incoming type state or the outgoing one.
    
*   The type state after the instruction completes abruptly is almost always identical to the incoming type state. The description only discusses the type state after the instruction completes abruptly when that is not the case.
    
*   The description speaks of popping and pushing types onto the operand stack, and does not explicitly discuss issues of stack underflow or overflow. The description assumes these operations can be completed successfully, but the Prolog clauses for operand stack manipulation ensure that the necessary checks are made.
    
*   The description discusses only the manipulation of logical types. In practice, some types take more than one word. The description abstracts from these representation details, but the Prolog clauses that manipulate data do not.
    

Any ambiguities can be resolved by referring to the formal Prolog clauses.

##### _aaload_

An _aaload_ instruction is type safe iff one can validly replace types matching `int` and an array type with component type `ComponentType` where `ComponentType` is a subtype of `Object`, with `ComponentType` yielding the outgoing type state.

    *   One can validly replace types matching the class `MethodClassName` and the argument types given in `Descriptor` on the incoming operand stack with the return type given in `Descriptor`.
        
    

```
instructionIsTypeSafe(invokespecial(CP), Environment, \_Offset, StackFrame,
                      NextStackFrame, ExceptionStackFrame) :- 
    CP = method(MethodClassName, MethodName, Descriptor),

                        StackFrame, \_ResultStackFrame),
    exceptionStackFrame(StackFrame, ExceptionStackFrame).

```

The `isAssignable` clause enforces the structural constraint that _invokespecial_, for other than an instance initialization method, must name a method in the current class/interface or a superclass/superinterface.

The first `validTypeTransition` clause enforces the structural constraint that _invokespecial_, for other than an instance initialization method, targets a receiver object of the current class or deeper. To see why, consider that `StackArgList` simulates the list of types on the operand stack expected by the method, starting with the current class (the class performing _invokespecial_). The actual types on the operand stack are in `StackFrame`. The effect of `validTypeTransition` is to pop the first type from the operand stack in `StackFrame` and check it is a subtype of the first term of `StackArgList`, namely the current class. Thus, the actual receiver type is compatible with the current class.

A sharp-eyed reader might notice that enforcing this structural constraint supercedes the structural constraint pertaining to _invokespecial_ of a `protected` method. Thus, the Prolog code above makes no reference to `passesProtectedCheck` ([§4.10.1.8](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.8 "4.10.1.8. Type Checking for protected Members")), whereas the Prolog code for _invokespecial_ of an instance initialization method uses `passesProtectedCheck` to ensure the actual receiver type is compatible with the current class when certain `protected` instance initialization methods are named.

The second `validTypeTransition` clause enforces the structural constraint that any method invocation instruction must target a receiver object whose type is compatible with the type named by the instruction. To see why, consider that `StackArgList2` simulates the list of types on the operand stack expected by the method, starting with the type named by the instruction. Again, the actual types on the operand stack are in `StackFrame`, and the effect of `validTypeTransition` is to check the actual receiver type in `StackFrame` is compatible with the type named by the instruction in `StackArgList2`.

*   Or:
    
    *   MethodName is `<init>`.
        
    *   `Descriptor` specifies a `void` return type.
        
    *   One can validly pop types matching the argument types given in `Descriptor` and an uninitialized type, `UninitializedArg`, off the incoming operand stack, yielding `OperandStack`.
        
    *   The outgoing type state is derived from the incoming type state by first replacing the incoming operand stack with `OperandStack` and then replacing all instances of `UninitializedArg` with the type of instance being initialized.
        
    *   If the instruction calls an instance initialization method on a class instance created by an earlier _new_ instruction, and the method is `protected`, the usage conforms to the special rules governing access to `protected` members ([§4.10.1.8](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.8 "4.10.1.8. Type Checking for protected Members")).

To compute what type the uninitialized argument's type needs to be rewritten to, there are two cases:

*   If we are initializing an object within its constructor, its type is initially `uninitializedThis`. This type will be rewritten to the type of the class of the `<init>` method.
    
*   The second case arises from initialization of an object created by _new_. The uninitialized arg type is rewritten to `MethodClass`, the type of the method holder of `<init>`. We check whether there really is a _new_ instruction at `Address`.

substitute(Old, New, \[From1 | FromRest\], \[From1 | ToRest\]) :-
    From1 \\= Old,
    substitute(Old, New, FromRest, ToRest).

```

The rule for _invokespecial_ of an `<init>` method is the sole motivation for passing back a distinct exception stack frame. The concern is that when initializing an object within its constructor, _invokespecial_ can cause a superclass `<init>` method to be invoked, and that invocation could fail, leaving `this` uninitialized. This situation cannot be created using source code in the Java programming language, but can be created by programming in bytecode directly.

In this situation, the original frame holds an uninitialized object in local variable 0 and has flag `flagThisUninit`. Normal termination of _invokespecial_ initializes the uninitialized object and turns off the `flagThisUninit` flag. But if the invocation of an `<init>` method throws an exception, the uninitialized object might be left in a partially initialized state, and needs to be made permanently unusable. This is represented by an exception frame containing the broken object (the new value of the local) and the `flagThisUninit` flag (the old flag). There is no way to get from an apparently-initialized object bearing the `flagThisUninit` flag to a properly initialized object, so the object is permanently unusable.

If not for this situation, the flags of the exception stack frame would always be the same as the flags of the input stack frame.

### 4.10.2. Verification by Type Inference

A `class` file that does not contain a `StackMapTable` attribute (which necessarily has a version number of 49.0 or below) must be verified using type inference.

#### 4.10.2.1. The Process of Verification by Type Inference

During linking, the verifier checks the `code` array of the `Code` attribute for each method of the `class` file by performing data-flow analysis on each method. The verifier ensures that at any given point in the program, no matter what code path is taken to reach that point, all of the following are true:

*   The operand stack is always the same size and contains the same types of values.
    
*   No local variable is accessed unless it is known to contain a value of an appropriate type.
    
*   Methods are invoked with the appropriate arguments.
    
*   Fields are assigned only using values of appropriate types.
    
*   All opcodes have appropriately typed arguments on the operand stack and in the local variable array.
    

For efficiency reasons, certain tests that could in principle be performed by the verifier are delayed until the first time the code for the method is actually invoked. In so doing, the verifier avoids loading `class` files unless it has to.

For example, if a method invokes another method that returns an instance of class A, and that instance is assigned only to a field of the same type, the verifier does not bother to check if the class A actually exists. However, if it is assigned to a field of the type B, the definitions of both A and B must be loaded in to ensure that A is a subclass of B.

#### 4.10.2.2. The Bytecode Verifier

The code for each method is verified independently. First, the bytes that make up the code are broken up into a sequence of instructions, and the index into the `code` array of the start of each instruction is placed in an array. The verifier then goes through the code a second time and parses the instructions. During this pass a data structure is built to hold information about each Java Virtual Machine instruction in the method. The operands, if any, of each instruction are checked to make sure they are valid. For instance:

*   Branches must be within the bounds of the `code` array for the method.
    
*   The targets of all control-flow instructions are each the start of an instruction. In the case of a _wide_ instruction, the _wide_ opcode is considered the start of the instruction, and the opcode giving the operation modified by that _wide_ instruction is not considered to start an instruction. Branches into the middle of an instruction are disallowed.
    
*   No instruction can access or modify a local variable at an index greater than or equal to the number of local variables that its method indicates it allocates.
    
*   All references to the constant pool must be to an entry of the appropriate type. (For example, the instruction _getfield_ must reference a field.)
    
*   The code does not end in the middle of an instruction.
    
*   Execution cannot fall off the end of the code.
    
*   For each exception handler, the starting and ending point of code protected by the handler must be at the beginning of an instruction or, in the case of the ending point, immediately past the end of the code. The starting point must be before the ending point. The exception handler code must start at a valid instruction, and it must not start at an opcode being modified by the _wide_ instruction.
    

For each instruction of the method, the verifier records the contents of the operand stack and the contents of the local variable array prior to the execution of that instruction. For the operand stack, it needs to know the stack height and the type of each value on it. For each local variable, it needs to know either the type of the contents of that local variable or that the local variable contains an unusable or unknown value (it might be uninitialized). The bytecode verifier does not need to distinguish between the integral types (e.g., `byte`, `short`, `char`) when determining the value types on the operand stack.

Next, a data-flow analyzer is initialized. For the first instruction of the method, the local variables that represent parameters initially contain values of the types indicated by the method's type descriptor; the operand stack is empty. All other local variables contain an illegal value. For the other instructions, which have not been examined yet, no information is available regarding the operand stack or local variables.

Finally, the data-flow analyzer is run. For each instruction, a "changed" bit indicates whether this instruction needs to be looked at. Initially, the "changed" bit is set only for the first instruction. The data-flow analyzer executes the following loop:

1.  Select a Java Virtual Machine instruction whose "changed" bit is set. If no instruction remains whose "changed" bit is set, the method has successfully been verified. Otherwise, turn off the "changed" bit of the selected instruction.
    
2.  Model the effect of the instruction on the operand stack and local variable array by doing the following:
    
    *   If the instruction uses values from the operand stack, ensure that there are a sufficient number of values on the stack and that the top values on the stack are of an appropriate type. Otherwise, verification fails.
        
    *   If the instruction uses a local variable, ensure that the specified local variable contains a value of the appropriate type. Otherwise, verification fails.
        
    *   If the instruction pushes values onto the operand stack, ensure that there is sufficient room on the operand stack for the new values. Add the indicated types to the top of the modeled operand stack.
        
    *   If the instruction modifies a local variable, record that the local variable now contains the new type.
        
    
3.  Determine the instructions that can follow the current instruction. Successor instructions can be one of the following:
    
    *   The next instruction, if the current instruction is not an unconditional control transfer instruction (for instance, _goto_, _return_, or _athrow_). Verification fails if it is possible to "fall off" the last instruction of the method.
        
    *   The target(s) of a conditional or unconditional branch or switch.
        
    *   Any exception handlers for this instruction.
        
    
4.  Merge the state of the operand stack and local variable array at the end of the execution of the current instruction into each of the successor instructions, as follows:
    
    *   If this is the first time the successor instruction has been visited, record that the operand stack and local variable values calculated in step 2 are the state of the operand stack and local variable array prior to executing the successor instruction. Set the "changed" bit for the successor instruction.
        
    *   If the successor instruction has been seen before, merge the operand stack and local variable values calculated in step 2 into the values already there. Set the "changed" bit if there is any modification to the values.
        
    
    In the special case of control transfer to an exception handler:
    
    *   Record that a single object, of the exception type indicated by the exception handler, is the state of the operand stack prior to executing the successor instruction. There must be sufficient room on the operand stack for this single value, as if an instruction had pushed it.
        
    *   Record that the local variable values from immediately before step 2 are the state of the local variable array prior to executing the successor instruction. The local variable values calculated in step 2 are irrelevant.
        
    
5.  Continue at step 1.
    

To merge two operand stacks, the number of values on each stack must be identical. Then, corresponding values on the two stacks are compared and the value on the merged stack is computed, as follows:

*   If one value is a primitive type, then the corresponding value must be the same primitive type. The merged value is the primitive type.
    
*   If one value is a non-array reference type, then the corresponding value must be a reference type (array or non-array). The merged value is a reference to an instance of the first common supertype of the two reference types. (Such a reference type always exists because the type `Object` is a supertype of all class, interface, and array types.)
    
    For example, `Object` and `String` can be merged; the result is `Object`. Similarly, `Object` and `String``[]` can be merged; the result is again `Object`. Even `Object` and `int``[]` can be merged, or `String` and `int``[]`; the result is `Object` for both.
    
*   If corresponding values are both array reference types, then their dimensions are examined. If the array types have the same dimensions, then the merged value is a `reference` to an instance of an array type which is first common supertype of both array types. (If either or both of the array types has a primitive element type, then `Object` is used as the element type instead.) If the array types have different dimensions, then the merged value is a `reference` to an instance of an array type whose dimension is the smaller of the two; the element type is `Cloneable` or `java.io.Serializable` if the smaller array type was `Cloneable` or `java.io.Serializable`, and `Object` otherwise.
    
    For example, `Object``[]` and `String``[]` can be merged; the result is `Object``[]`. `Cloneable``[]` and `String``[]` can be merged, or `java.io.Serializable``[]` and `String``[]`; the result is `Cloneable``[]` and `java.io.Serializable``[]` respectively. Even `int``[]` and `String``[]` can be merged; the result is `Object``[]`, because `Object` is used instead of `int` when computing the first common supertype.
    
    Since the array types can have different dimensions, `Object``[]` and `String``[]``[]` can be merged, or `Object``[]``[]` and `String``[]`; in both cases the result is `Object``[]`. `Cloneable``[]` and `String``[]``[]` can be merged; the result is `Cloneable``[]`. Finally, `Cloneable``[]``[]` and `String``[]` can be merged; the result is `Object``[]`.
    

If the operand stacks cannot be merged, verification of the method fails.

To merge two local variable array states, corresponding pairs of local variables are compared. The value of the merged local variable is computed using the rules above, except that the corresponding values are permitted to be different primitive types. In that case, the verifier records that the merged local variable contains an unusable value.

If the data-flow analyzer runs on a method without reporting a verification failure, then the method has been successfully verified by the `class` file verifier.

Certain instructions and data types complicate the data-flow analyzer. We now examine each of these in more detail.

#### 4.10.2.3. Values of Types `long` and `double`

Values of the `long` and `double` types are treated specially by the verification process.

Whenever a value of type `long` or `double` is moved into a local variable at index _n_, index _n_+1 is specially marked to indicate that it has been reserved by the value at index _n_ and must not be used as a local variable index. Any value previously at index _n_+1 becomes unusable.

Whenever a value is moved to a local variable at index _n_, the index _n_\-1 is examined to see if it is the index of a value of type `long` or `double`. If so, the local variable at index _n_\-1 is changed to indicate that it now contains an unusable value. Since the local variable at index _n_ has been overwritten, the local variable at index _n_\-1 cannot represent a value of type `long` or `double`.

Dealing with values of types `long` or `double` on the operand stack is simpler; the verifier treats them as single values on the stack. For example, the verification code for the _dadd_ opcode (add two `double` values) checks that the top two items on the stack are both of type `double`. When calculating operand stack length, values of type `long` and `double` have length two.

Untyped instructions that manipulate the operand stack must treat values of type `long` and `double` as atomic (indivisible). For example, the verifier reports a failure if the top value on the stack is a `double` and it encounters an instruction such as _pop_ or _dup_. The instructions _pop2_ or _dup2_ must be used instead.

#### 4.10.2.4. Instance Initialization Methods and Newly Created Objects

Creating a new class instance is a multistep process. The statement:

```
...
new myClass(i, j, k);
...

```

can be implemented by the following:

```
...
new #1            // Allocate uninitialized space for myClass
dup               // Duplicate object on the operand stack
iload\_1           // Push i
iload\_2           // Push j
iload\_3           // Push k
invokespecial #5  // Invoke myClass.`<init>`
...

```

This instruction sequence leaves the newly created and initialized object on top of the operand stack. (Additional examples of compilation to the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine are given in [§3 (_Compiling for the Java Virtual Machine_)](jvms-3.html "Chapter 3. Compiling for the Java Virtual Machine").)

The instance initialization method ([§2.9.1](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.9.1 "2.9.1. Instance Initialization Methods")) for class `myClass` sees the new uninitialized object as its `this` argument in local variable 0. Before that method invokes another instance initialization method of `myClass` or its direct superclass on `this`, the only operation the method can perform on `this` is assigning fields declared within `myClass`.

When doing dataflow analysis on instance methods, the verifier initializes local variable 0 to contain an object of the current class, or, for instance initialization methods, local variable 0 contains a special type indicating an uninitialized object. After an appropriate instance initialization method is invoked (from the current class or its direct superclass) on this object, all occurrences of this special type on the verifier's model of the operand stack and in the local variable array are replaced by the current class type. The verifier rejects code that uses the new object before it has been initialized or that initializes the object more than once. In addition, it ensures that every normal return of the method has invoked an instance initialization method either in the class of this method or in the direct superclass.

Similarly, a special type is created and pushed on the verifier's model of the operand stack as the result of the Java Virtual Machine instruction _new_. The special type indicates the instruction by which the class instance was created and the type of the uninitialized class instance created. When an instance initialization method declared in the class of the uninitialized class instance is invoked on that class instance, all occurrences of the special type are replaced by the intended type of the class instance. This change in type may propagate to subsequent instructions as the dataflow analysis proceeds.

The instruction number needs to be stored as part of the special type, as there may be multiple not-yet-initialized instances of a class in existence on the operand stack at one time. For example, the Java Virtual Machine instruction sequence that implements:

```
new InputStream(new Foo(), new InputStream("foo"))

```

may have two uninitialized instances of `InputStream` on the operand stack at once. When an instance initialization method is invoked on a class instance, only those occurrences of the special type on the operand stack or in the local variable array that are the same object as the class instance are replaced.

#### 4.10.2.5. Exceptions and `finally`

To implement the `try`\-`finally` construct, a compiler for the Java programming language that generates `class` files with version number 50.0 or below may use the exception-handling facilities together with two special instructions: _jsr_ ("jump to subroutine") and _ret_ ("return from subroutine"). The `finally` clause is compiled as a subroutine within the Java Virtual Machine code for its method, much like the code for an exception handler. When a _jsr_ instruction that invokes the subroutine is executed, it pushes its return address, the address of the instruction after the _jsr_ that is being executed, onto the operand stack as a value of type `returnAddress`. The code for the subroutine stores the return address in a local variable. At the end of the subroutine, a _ret_ instruction fetches the return address from the local variable and transfers control to the instruction at the return address.

Control can be transferred to the `finally` clause (the `finally` subroutine can be invoked) in several different ways. If the `try` clause completes normally, the `finally` subroutine is invoked via a _jsr_ instruction before evaluating the next expression. A `break` or `continue` inside the `try` clause that transfers control outside the `try` clause executes a _jsr_ to the code for the `finally` clause first. If the `try` clause executes a _return_, the compiled code does the following:

1.  Saves the return value (if any) in a local variable.
    
2.  Executes a _jsr_ to the code for the `finally` clause.
    
3.  Upon return from the `finally` clause, returns the value saved in the local variable.
    

The compiler sets up a special exception handler, which catches any exception thrown by the `try` clause. If an exception is thrown in the `try` clause, this exception handler does the following:

1.  Saves the exception in a local variable.
    
2.  Executes a _jsr_ to the `finally` clause.
    
3.  Upon return from the `finally` clause, rethrows the exception.
    

For more information about the implementation of the `try`\-`finally` construct, see [§3.13](jvms-3.html#jvms-3.13 "3.13. Compiling finally").

The code for the `finally` clause presents a special problem to the verifier. Usually, if a particular instruction can be reached via multiple paths and a particular local variable contains incompatible values through those multiple paths, then the local variable becomes unusable. However, a `finally` clause might be called from several different places, yielding several different circumstances:

*   The invocation from the exception handler may have a certain local variable that contains an exception.
    
*   The invocation to implement _return_ may have some local variable that contains the return value.
    
*   The invocation from the bottom of the `try` clause may have an indeterminate value in that same local variable.
    

The code for the `finally` clause itself might pass verification, but after completing the updating all the successors of the _ret_ instruction, the verifier would note that the local variable that the exception handler expects to hold an exception, or that the return code expects to hold a return value, now contains an indeterminate value.

Verifying code that contains a `finally` clause is complicated. The basic idea is the following:

*   Each instruction keeps track of the list of _jsr_ targets needed to reach that instruction. For most code, this list is empty. For instructions inside code for the `finally` clause, it is of length one. For multiply nested `finally` code (extremely rare!), it may be longer than one.
    
*   For each instruction and each _jsr_ needed to reach that instruction, a bit vector is maintained of all local variables accessed or modified since the execution of the _jsr_ instruction.
    
*   When executing the _ret_ instruction, which implements a return from a subroutine, there must be only one possible subroutine from which the instruction can be returning. Two different subroutines cannot "merge" their execution to a single _ret_ instruction.
    
*   To perform the data-flow analysis on a _ret_ instruction, a special procedure is used. Since the verifier knows the subroutine from which the instruction must be returning, it can find all the _jsr_ instructions that call the subroutine and merge the state of the operand stack and local variable array at the time of the _ret_ instruction into the operand stack and local variable array of the instructions following the _jsr_. Merging uses a special set of values for local variables:
    
    *   For any local variable that the bit vector (constructed above) indicates has been accessed or modified by the subroutine, use the type of the local variable at the time of the _ret_.
        
    *   For other local variables, use the type of the local variable before the _jsr_ instruction.
        
    

4.11. Limitations of the Java Virtual Machine
---------------------------------------------

The following limitations of the Java Virtual Machine are implicit in the `class` file format:

*   The per-class or per-interface constant pool is limited to 65535 entries by the 16-bit `constant_pool_count` field of the `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")). This acts as an internal limit on the total complexity of a single class or interface.
    
*   The number of fields that may be declared by a class or interface is limited to 65535 by the size of the `fields_count` item of the `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")).
    
    Note that the value of the `fields_count` item of the `ClassFile` structure does not include fields that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.
    
*   The number of methods that may be declared by a class or interface is limited to 65535 by the size of the `methods_count` item of the `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")).
    
    Note that the value of the `methods_count` item of the `ClassFile` structure does not include methods that are inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces.
    
*   The number of direct superinterfaces of a class or interface is limited to 65535 by the size of the `interfaces_count` item of the `ClassFile` structure ([§4.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.1 "4.1. The ClassFile Structure")).
    
*   The greatest number of local variables in the local variables array of a frame created upon invocation of a method ([§2.6](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6 "2.6. Frames")) is limited to 65535 by the size of the `max_locals` item of the `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")) giving the code of the method, and by the 16-bit local variable indexing of the Java Virtual Machine instruction set.
    
    Note that values of type `long` and `double` are each considered to reserve two local variables and contribute two units toward the `max_locals` value, so use of local variables of those types further reduces this limit.
    
*   The size of an operand stack in a frame ([§2.6](jvms-2.html#jvms-2.6 "2.6. Frames")) is limited to 65535 values by the `max_stack` field of the `Code` attribute ([§4.7.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.3 "4.7.3. The Code Attribute")).
    
    Note that values of type `long` and `double` are each considered to contribute two units toward the `max_stack` value, so use of values of these types on the operand stack further reduces this limit.
    
*   The number of method parameters is limited to 255 by the definition of a method descriptor ([§4.3.3](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.3.3 "4.3.3. Method Descriptors")), where the limit includes one unit for `this` in the case of instance or interface method invocations.
    
    Note that a method descriptor is defined in terms of a notion of method parameter length in which a parameter of type `long` or `double` contributes two units to the length, so parameters of these types further reduce the limit.
    
*   The length of field and method names, field and method descriptors, and other constant string values (including those referenced by `ConstantValue` ([§4.7.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.2 "4.7.2. The ConstantValue Attribute")) attributes) is limited to 65535 characters by the 16-bit unsigned `length` item of the `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure ([§4.4.7](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.4.7 "4.4.7. The CONSTANT_Utf8_info Structure")).
    
    Note that the limit is on the number of bytes in the encoding and not on the number of encoded characters. UTF-8 encodes some characters using two or three bytes. Thus, strings incorporating multibyte characters are further constrained.
    
*   The number of dimensions in an array is limited to 255 by the size of the _dimensions_ opcode of the _multianewarray_ instruction and by the constraints imposed on the _multianewarray_, _anewarray_, and _newarray_ instructions ([§4.9.1](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.9.1 "4.9.1. Static Constraints"), [§4.9.2](jvms-4.html#jvms-4.9.2 "4.9.2. Structural Constraints")).
